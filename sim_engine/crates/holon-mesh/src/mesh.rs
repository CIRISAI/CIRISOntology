//! The mesh: ONE scene, sharded across arenas, with a halo whose depth is a theorem.
//!
//! # The scheme
//!
//! A shard owns a rectangular block of cells and holds a **halo** — scratch copies of the
//! cells within `n·r` of what it owns. Between exchanges it runs `n` colour sweeps. During
//! those sweeps it updates its halo copies too, and they decay from the outside in: after
//! `k` sweeps everything at halo depth `≤ n − k` is still exact, so after all `n` sweeps the
//! owned cells (depth 0) are exact. Then the halo is refreshed and the cycle repeats.
//!
//! **A shard writes authoritatively only what it owns.** Halo copies are scratch, recomputed
//! from their owners at every exchange, and never read back by anyone. That is what makes
//! conservation exact without a transfer protocol on top: for a boundary adjacency, the shard
//! owning `lo` applies `−d` to its owned cell, the shard owning `hi` applies `+d` to its
//! owned cell, and both compute the same `d` from bit-identical integer inputs. The scene
//! total moves by zero, in all four lanes, by arithmetic.
//!
//! # Why the halo depth is `n·r` and not a tuning parameter
//!
//! `CIRISOntology/Core/Locality.lean`:
//!
//! * `depends_within_comp` — locality composes and the radii ADD;
//! * `iterate_depends_within` — `n` steps of a radius-`r` update depend within `n·r`.
//!
//! So `n·r` **suffices**, and the code asserts the halo is built to exactly that. Whether it
//! is also *necessary* is not something the Lean says, and this crate does not assume it:
//! [`Mutation::HaloOneShallowerThanHorizon`] builds `n·r − 1` and the gate measures whether
//! the answer moves. The bound's tightness is a measurement here, not a citation.
//!
//! # Single tier, asserted
//!
//! Every shard declares the same `g0` — this is a refinement relation, never a re-root.
//! `Core/GrainFloor.lean::cert_does_not_transport_across_reroot` is why that is a fence:
//! nothing in the engine certifies a join across a re-root, so a multi-tier mesh would be
//! uncertified by construction (`SANDBOX_4090` G4). [`MeshSpec`] carries one `g0` for the
//! whole scene and there is no way to express a second.

            //     any feedback scaling rounds that straight back away. So the summands here
            //     span a wide dynamic range on purpose: the momentum terms drive the running
            //     total to ~1e14 while the occupancy terms are ~1e1, so each small term is
            //     absorbed against a large and ORDER-DEPENDENT running magnitude. The spread
            //     is then hundreds of ULPs instead of one.
            //
            // (2) **Bounded.** `acc` reads the INTEGER lanes, never the energy it feeds. An
            //     earlier version multiplied by energy and the feedback amplified itself
            //     ~26x per sweep, driving every cell to the same 1e17 value — an instrument
            //     that destroys the per-cell structure it is supposed to be measuring.
            //     A third attempt failed too, and for a reason worth keeping: summing
            //     `momentum * 1e12 + occupancy` is a sum of INTEGERS below 2^53, and float
            //     addition of those is EXACT — so it was perfectly order-independent. The
