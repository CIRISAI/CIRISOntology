//! The zoom ladder: which grain constant each tier declares, and what the REG+ ledger
//! will actually let it count.
//!
//! # The ladder is arithmetic, not taste
//!
//! `GrossState` has FOUR integer lanes and `Holon::grain_units` is a `u32`. Together
//! they decide how far one arena can zoom, and they bind hard:
//!
//! * a dense 3D scene fits `u64` only while `extent / g0 <= 2.642e6` — **6.42 decades**;
//! * `grain_units` is a diameter ratio, so no arena spans more than `4.295e9` — **9.63
//!   decades** — whatever its density.
//!
//! ## Which lane binds is a property of the CHART, not of the ledger
//!
//! The obvious lane is `constituents`, and for this demo it is the right one — but only
//! because of something the chart does. `GrossState` also carries `occupancy: u64` and
//! `momentum: [i64; 2]`, and a chart that writes REG+ occupancy per leaf overflows
//! EARLIER than the constituent count does. Credit to the 4090 study for catching this;
//! the first version of this header quoted the constituents lane as if it were the only
//! one.
//!
//! One 0.5 mm quartz grain is **5.216e18 atoms**. Against that:
//!
//! | what the chart writes per leaf | binding lane | cap | grains of sand |
//! |---|---|---:|---:|
//! | occupancy 0 (this demo) | `constituents` | 1.845e19 | **3.54** |
//! | occupancy 2 (the `gross(n) = aggregate(n, 2n, …)` idiom) | `occupancy` | 9.223e18 | 1.77 |
//! | occupancy 6 (REG+ maximum, all six directions) | `occupancy` | 3.075e18 | 0.59 |
//! | momentum component 3 (FHP maximum) | `momentum` | 3.075e18 | 0.59 |
//!
//! So "the ledger holds three and a half grains of sand" is a statement about THIS
//! chart. The general bound is 0.59 grains, six times tighter, and it is reached by any
//! chart whose leaves carry full REG+ occupancy. [`ledger_for`] checks every lane;
//! `tests::the_binding_lane_is_a_property_of_the_chart` pins both readings, and
//! `scene::tests::the_sandbox_chart_writes_no_occupancy` is what earns this demo the
//! looser one.
//! The sandbox in this demo holds 6.60e8 grains; expressed in atoms that is 3.44e27,
//! which is **1.87e8 times** over the cap, and `GrossState::checked_combine` returns
//! `None` rather than a wrong number. The observable universe in atoms is over by 5.4e60.
//!
//! That refusal is the frame working, and it is why zoom here is a **re-root**: each
//! tier is its own arena with its own declared `g0`, which `CIRIS_HOLON_ENGINE.md`
//! already licenses ("There is no absolute maximal holon. A root can become a child when
//! a larger holarchy is formed"). Re-rooting is a VALUES change — a different grain
//! constant on the scene chart — not a new object, not a new field, not a second
//! ontology. [`Tier::ledger`] is that arithmetic made executable, and
//! [`Ledger::Overflows`] is what the demo shows when a user asks for a grain the ledger
//! cannot carry.
//!
//! # Square domains, and a debt that turned out not to be owed
//!
//! Every tier's domain is SQUARE, so the 2x2 quadtree halves both axes and cells stay
//! square at every depth. `ciris_sim_core::fracture::WallChart` is square-only and that
//! was on the list of debts to pay here; choosing square domains means the demo does not
//! need per-axis extents at all. A sandbox is a square domain with sand in the lower
//! part and air above — the air cells are ordinary holons carrying zero constituents,
//! and the ledger composes exactly through them. Building rectangular charts that
//! nothing uses would have been machinery, not payment.
//!
//! # Two dimensions on purpose
//!
//! The chart is 2D; the LEDGER is 3D. A tier's `constituents` is the real count of
//! physical terminal holons — grains, unit cells, galaxies — while the quadtree cells
//! are the resident refinement window over them. That split is the shipped demo's own
//! (`holon-ball-game` carries a 1,000,000-holon wall on 288 2D nodes) and it is stated
//! here rather than left for a reader to infer.
