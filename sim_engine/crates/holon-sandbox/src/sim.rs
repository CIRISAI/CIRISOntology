/// also keeps static curvature separate from expansion: a static metric has a timelike
/// Killing vector, so a conserved energy exists there and only this instrument is missing.
///
/// # THE VERDICT ON THE FIRST RUN: the engine does not create energy. The ledger did.
///
/// This ledger's first run reported that the sandbox scene **gains 1.14 J of 107 (+1.06%)**
/// over four seconds, and that the landscape tier's named channels explained only **24%** of
/// what it dissipates. It named two open candidates — semi-implicit Euler injecting on stiff
/// contacts, and the `.max(0.0)` clamp on the contact force. **Both candidates are wrong, and
/// neither number was a defect in the engine.** Both were gaps in this instrument, and they
/// are two different ones:
///
/// * The **gain** was the overlap-potential term measuring from `radius[i] + radius[j]` where
///   the force law measures from [`Session::rest_gap`]. The term is summed over the pairs
///   adjacent to AWAKE cells, so the fiction switched on as the throw woke the scene and
///   read as energy appearing. Decomposed: of the +1.1389 J gain, **+1.1534 J is that term**
///   and every other component is negative. See [`Session::total_energy_j`].
/// * The **76% unexplained** was `contact_damping_j` charged at the grain-grain contacts and
///   not at the projectile's, which at the landscape tier is where the energy actually goes.
///
/// With both corrected, every tier DISSIPATES and the two-sided balance closes:
///
/// | tier | dissipated | named channels | explained | residual |
/// |---|---|---|---|---|
/// | Sandbox | +1.3368e-2 J | 1.2514e-2 J | **93.6%** | +6.4% |
/// | Grain | +9.2630e-15 J | 8.8380e-15 J | **95.4%** | +4.6% |
/// | Landscape | +6.3847e7 J | 6.3336e7 J | **99.2%** | +0.8% |
///
/// The residual is now positive at every tier — a LOSS, which is the only sign an
/// uninstrumented sink or an explicit integrator can have here. What is left in it, named so
/// the next reader starts past this point: the projectile's contact potential is not in
/// `E(t)` at all (see [`Session::total_energy_j`]); a projectile contact against an ASLEEP
/// cell applies no force to that cell, so the momentum is dropped rather than delivered
/// (measured at 1.3e-4 J of the sandbox's 1.34e-2 and 8.3e5 J of the landscape's 6.4e7,

/// * `wall_clamp_nats` — a cell past the floor or a side wall has its **position** set to
///   exactly the wall. An interval of positions maps to one point.

/// **The wall's velocity flip is NOT a merge site**, and this is worth stating because it

/// representable values, so `ln(|x|/ulp(x))` nats. For any normal `f64` that is
/// **≈ 36.0 nats (52 bits)** — the mantissa — so the event count and the nats are near

/// # Sign

/// # THE VERDICT: at these three sites the ledger is an EVENT COUNTER in expensive units
///

/// | tier | sleep | wall clamp | anchor | total |
/// |---|---|---|---|---|

/// | Landscape | 3,786 nats / 52 ev | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 | 3,786 nats |
///
/// **The per-event price is 72.76 / 72.78 / 72.80 nats for a sleep and 36.28 for a wall
/// clamp, and it is the same everywhere because it is a fact about `f64` and not about the
/// scene.** `nats_collapsed` returns `ln(|x|/ulp(x))`, which is the mantissa — ≈36.4 nats —
/// for every normal double there is. So the nats and the events are proportional to within
/// 0.05% across every tier, and the ledger's reading is the event count in disguise.
///
/// **That is the sharpest form of the two-currency claim and also this instrument's limit.**
/// Set the two ledgers side by side on the SAME site, sleep: the D-ledger charges 2.76e-12 J

/// magnitude apart** — while the sigma-ledger charges 72.76 and 72.80 nats. Energy loss and
/// information loss are genuinely different events, and no conversion factor relates them.
/// But it also means this ledger **cannot tell a cheap collapse from an expensive one**: it
/// would read the same whether the engine slept a cell at 1 m/s or at 1e-30 m/s.
///
/// So the readings are a **CEILING on distinguishability destroyed, not a measurement of

    /// * `contact_damping_j` charged at grain-grain contacts and not at the projectile's,
    ///   which at the landscape tier is 4.82e7 J — 99% of what was reported as unexplained.

    /// | Landscape | +6.3847e7 J | 6.3336e7 J | **99.2%** | +0.8% |

    ///
    /// An earlier version of this test justified itself by citing
    /// `production_eq_zero_iff_rate_injective`: a stable step is injective, an injective step
    /// produces nothing, so energy creation is a fact the theory does not predict.
    /// **WITHDRAWN — that conflates energy with entropy.** Injectivity is about
    /// *information*; production is the log-degree of the rate map. **An injective map can
    /// create energy freely**: scale every velocity by 1.01 and the map is a bijection that
    /// manufactures joules. `Habit.lean` says nothing about this ledger's finding, and the
    /// programme's own rule — one ledger per quantity, dissipated energy and produced entropy
    /// being two quantities — is exactly what that citation broke. Kept here, marked dead,
    /// rather than quietly deleted.
    ///
    /// The correct warrant is ordinary physics and it is narrower. **At the tiers this gate
    /// runs on, the chart is flat, Newtonian, of fixed volume and fixed particle number, and
    /// its gravity is static.** That chart has time-translation symmetry, so Noether's
    /// theorem gives a conserved energy in the continuum equations, and a secular gain is a
    /// defect: integrator, unaccounted declared channel, or bug. Not a lake theorem. Which is
    /// also why the gate must ask [`Session::balance_applicability`] first — see
    /// [`BalanceApplicability`], and `the_gate_refuses_where_the_chart_has_no_conserved_energy`.
    ///
    /// # THE ARGUMENT for accounting gap over integrator error, rather than the conclusion
    ///
    /// The discriminator is the design's own: `residual / (E(0) − E(t))`, and what happens to
    /// it. Three independent legs, and they point the same way.
    ///
    /// 1. **The gain was never in the dynamics.** `total_energy_j` is a `&self` read called
    ///    in exactly two places — `throw`, to set `E(0)`, and this gate. It cannot feed back.
    ///    Changing its zero point moved the reading by 1.152 J **on a state that had not been
    ///    stepped**, which is what `the_gain_was_in_the_observer_not_the_dynamics` measures
    ///    with zero substeps taken. An integrator leak lives in the trajectory; this lived in
    ///    the observer, and the two are distinguishable by exactly that test.
    /// 2. **The loss was recoverable by naming one channel.** Instrumenting the projectile's
    ///    contact damping recovered 4.82e7 J of the landscape's 4.87e7 J residual — **99.0%,
    ///    and the recovered quantity is that channel's own time integral**, not a fitted
    ///    remainder. Integrator error is not recoverable by naming a channel; that is the
    ///    difference between the two hypotheses, and the ratio went 76% → 0.8%.
    /// 3. **What remains has the wrong sign for the named candidate.** Semi-implicit Euler
    ///    injects on STIFF contacts, so that hypothesis predicts the residual fraction rises
    ///    with contact stiffness. Measured it falls: the landscape at `k = 2.44e13` N/m has
    ///    the smallest fraction (0.8%) and the sandbox at `k = 6.89e5` N/m — seven orders
    ///    softer — the largest (6.4%). Three tiers that differ in more than stiffness, so
    ///    this is a wrong-sign observation and not a measurement of the integrator's
    ///    contribution; it is reported at that strength.
    ///
    /// Every tier dissipates and every residual is a LOSS. That sign is load-bearing on its
    /// own terms: an explicit integrator and an uninstrumented sink can both only take energy
    /// out here, so a negative residual would be a fact neither explains.
    ///
    /// Ruled out and kept ruled out: adaptive materialization is not involved. The node count
    /// is constant across the flight (118,296 at the sandbox tier, before and after).
    ///
    /// What the 0.8–6.4% still holds is named in [`DissipationLedger`]'s header rather than
    /// left as slack: the projectile's contact potential is not in `E(t)`, a projectile
    /// contact against an asleep cell drops the momentum instead of delivering it, and
    /// semi-implicit Euler carries `O(dt)` error per step. The band is 90–100%, which is
