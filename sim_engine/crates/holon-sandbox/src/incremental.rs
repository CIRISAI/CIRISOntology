//! Incremental certification: the same selector, without the restart.
//!
//! # Why this exists (measured, not assumed)
//!
//! `ciris_sim_core::runtime::certify_runtime_adaptive` restarts selection at the
//! encounter root after every materialization, and `certify_runtime_in` refines exactly
//! one holon per `O(active)` evaluation. On this workstation (release, x86_64), with a
//! boundary model that does no physics at all — so the numbers are ENGINE cost only:
//!
//! | materializations | resident holons | seconds |
//! |---:|---:|---:|
//! | 22 | 89 | 0.0001 |
//! | 86 | 345 | 0.0023 |
//! | 342 | 1369 | 0.1286 |
//! | 1366 | 5465 | 6.9428 |
//!
//! Four times the materializations costs fifty-four times the wall clock: the growth is
//! cubic. A single full descent in isolation is quadratic (1369 holons 0.75 ms; 5465
//! holons 12.20 ms — already over a 60 fps frame by itself). A browser scene wants
//! thousands of resident cells per throw, so the shipped entry point is three orders of
//! magnitude short of the budget. This module pays that debt in-crate.
//!
//! # What is NOT changed
//!
//! The mathematics, the greedy rule, the tie-break, and the three verdicts are the
//! shipped ones. This is a workspace and a bookkeeping change, never a semantics
//! change:
//!
//! * the frontier still begins at the root and only ever refines;
//! * the candidate is still the highest-priority ACTIVE, BOUNDARY holon, with ties
//!   broken toward the LOWEST holon id — matching `certify_runtime_in`'s strict
//!   `score > priority` over ascending `active_indices()`;
//! * `GrainFloor` still outranks `RefinementUnavailable`;
//! * materialization is still transactional through `RuntimeArena::materialize`, so the
//!   REG+ ledger check is the core's, untouched.
//!
//! # The precondition, stated rather than hidden
//!
//! Dropping the restart is only sound for a **cell-max-decomposable** model: one whose
//! frontier error bound is the maximum of a per-cell error over the active set, and
//! whose refinement priority ranks by that same per-cell error. [`CellwiseModel`] is
//! that contract, and it is not a narrowing invented for convenience — the shipped
//! `FractureModel` already has exactly this shape (`fracture.rs`'s `bound()` is
//! `max(size / allowed_spacing(distance))` over `active_indices()`, and its
//! `refinement_priority` ranks by the same ratio).
//!
//! # Why the restart can be dropped, and the one case where it cannot
//!
//! For a model whose cell error is a pure function of the arena and the holon, the
//! greedy descent is memoryless: at every step it refines the highest-error refinable
//! active cell, so the sequence of frontiers is a function of the arena alone.
//! Materialization only APPENDS children, and a newly appended child is not active
//! until its parent is refined — so a restarted descent retraces exactly the frontier
//! it left and then continues. The restart is confluent, and skipping it is free.
//!
//! That argument uses staticness, and some models are not static: the shipped fracture
//! model's damage surface MOVES when a cohesive solve runs, and every cell error is
//! measured from that surface. Once the field moves, the frontier the incremental path
//! is standing on is path-dependent — refinements already made were justified under the
//! old field — and a restarted descent can legitimately reach a different frontier.
//!
//! So the restart is not dropped; it is made CONDITIONAL, and the condition is the
//! model's own declaration. [`CellwiseModel::epoch`] identifies the current cell-error
//! field. After a materialization, if the epoch has moved since the last descent began,
//! this certifier resets to the root and re-descends exactly as
//! `certify_runtime_adaptive` does. A static-field model never pays that; a moving-field
//! model pays it precisely where the shipped certifier does, and stays equivalent.
//!
//! This was not reasoned out in advance. The equivalence test below disagreed on a
//! moving-field model, and tracing that disagreement is what produced the paragraph
//! above. The static-field speedup is the same either way; the honest scope of the
//! claim is narrower than it first looked.
//!
//! The precondition is enforced by test, not by trust: [`certify_incremental`] and
//! `certify_runtime_adaptive` are run over the SAME model through [`PriorityAdapter`],
//! and their status, observables, residual, bound, materialization count and active
//! frontier must all agree bit-for-bit — with a moving-field model among the cases.
