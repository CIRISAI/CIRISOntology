//! One tier's scene: the arena, the generator that grows it, the model that certifies
//! it, and the one physics that runs on every tier that has one.
//!
//! # Sand is stone with the bonds already broken
//!
//! There is exactly one relation type here and exactly one solver. The difference
//! between the sandbox and the landscape is the INITIAL DAMAGE on the relation holons:
//! stone starts at `D = 0` and may break; sand starts at `D = 1` and cannot un-break.
//! That is not an analogy dressed up as a design. `material.rs`'s own jurisdiction rule
//! says a `D = 1` relation "returns zero forever" and hands its pair to the contact
//! solver, and that the solver's jurisdiction is "exactly the union of fully failed
//! (D = 1) pairs and never-bonded pairs". Granular contact is therefore the shipped
//! cohesive model at one particular value of one field, which is what "one holon,
//! values only" is supposed to mean when it is meant literally.
//!
//! # What the certificate is about
//!
//! The macro claim is the throw's IMPULSE and the extent of the disturbance it causes.
//! The resolution surrogate demands process-zone spacing near where the interaction is
//! and relaxes it linearly with distance, exactly as `fracture.rs` does around a damage
//! surface — with the throw's contact point standing in for the surface before anything
//! has been disturbed. Where a tier's own `l_ch/10` cannot be met at that tier's grain
//! floor, the answer is `GrainFloor` and no impulse is claimed.
