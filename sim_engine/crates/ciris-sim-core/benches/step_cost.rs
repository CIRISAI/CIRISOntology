//! Per-step cost of the integrator, and the zero-allocation claim — **measured, not
//! asserted**.
//!
//! Run: `cargo bench --bench step_cost`
//!
//! ## Scope, per FSD §10.1
//!
//! There is no comparison against any other engine here, and there must not be until
//! E10 (variable N) lands. The MVP is specialised to N=11 with compile-time tables, so
//! a win over an engine built for arbitrary lattices would measure the specialisation
//! and nothing else. §10's anti-hype clause is binding: *the benchmark counts only at
//! matched N with matched generality.* What follows is a self-measurement — a baseline
//! to regress against, not a score.
//!
//! ## How the zero-allocation claim is actually checked
//!
//! "The crate has no allocator, so it must be true" is an argument, not evidence, and
//! the interesting failure would be an allocation introduced by something the library
//! calls rather than by the library itself. So this bench installs a counting
//! `#[global_allocator]` and reads the counter immediately before and after each timed
//! region. A non-zero delta across a million steps is a failure the argument would not
//! have caught. Three independent lines of evidence are reported together:
//!
//! 1. **counted at runtime** — allocation/reallocation/free calls during the timed
//!    region, which must be exactly 0;
//! 2. **structural** — the crate is `#![no_std]` with no `extern crate alloc` and
//!    `libm` as its only dependency, so there is no allocator in the dependency graph
//!    to call (checked by `cargo tree`, see PORTABILITY.md);
//! 3. **on the wasm target** — the linear memory of the built module never grows across
//!    a long run, checked from the host (see PORTABILITY.md).
//!
//! Only (1) is measured *by this file*; (2) and (3) are commands recorded in
//! PORTABILITY.md so the claim is reproducible rather than taken on trust.
