//! Runtime linear algebra for the general-`N` path (FSD §10.2, gap E10).
//!
//! At `N = 11` the object is constant, so every derived quantity is a compile-time
//! table ([`crate::tables`]) and this module is never called. At any other `N` the
//! tables do not exist and the same quantities must be COMPUTED — the metric, the
//! Laplacian spectrum, the susceptibility. That is the honest cost of generality and
//! the FSD names it: "derived tables can no longer be precomputed".
//!
//! ## The constraints this module is written under
//!
//! `no_std`, no allocator, no `unsafe`, and bit-identical replay across
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, `wasm32-wasip1` and native. Together those rule out every
//! library eigensolver and every workspace-allocating algorithm, and they rule out
//! anything whose control flow depends on a pivot search over magnitudes. What is left
//! is **cyclic Jacobi**:
//!
//! * it needs exactly two `N x N` scratch arrays, both on the stack;
//! * its sweep order is fixed (`p` ascending, then `q > p` ascending) rather than
//!   chosen by looking at the data, so two runs take the same rotations in the same
//!   order and accumulate the same rounding;
//! * it is backward stable and, unlike QR, accurate in the *relative* sense on the
//!   small eigenvalues — which matters here because a Laplacian's zero mode is the
//!   thing the pseudo-inverse must discard, and discarding it correctly requires
//!   knowing it is small.
//!
//! Every numerical constant below is arbitrary in the sense that it was chosen rather
//! than derived, and each is named as such with the reasoning that fixed it.
