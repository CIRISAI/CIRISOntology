//! N-e — the full fracture composition (B4 regimes B/C): descriptor-built wall,
//! derived (k_n, k_t) bond laws, a thrown projectile, adaptive crack-tip
//! materialization, and node-node contact among the fragments — certified end to end.
//!
//! Everything here is composition, not invention. The pieces composed:
//!
//! * the wall is materialized through [`DescriptorMaterializer`] with quenched Record
//!   seeds, exactly as in `fracture.rs` (E1), reusing its [`WallChart`] spatial chart
//!   and [`TipSpacingSelector`];
//! * bond ELASTIC laws come from `homogenization.rs`: every relation carries the
//!   normal and tangential stiffnesses `k_n = t(λ+μ)`, `k_t = t(μ−λ)` that
//!   homogenize the square + alternating-diagonal stencil exactly to the
//!   descriptor's plane-stress `(E, ν)` — so the ν = 1/3 central-force restriction
//!   noted on E1 is paid here. The tangential spring requires rotational state to be
//!   frame-indifferent, so nodes carry spin and torque (BPM-style), with slip
//!   measured at the interface midpoint including spins — mirroring the landed
//!   ball-game realization;
//! * bond COHESIVE laws come from [`derive_bilinear_cohesive_law`] at the bond's own
//!   local pitch, then quenched by the endpoint [`GrainDraw`]s (weakest-link
//!   strength, diameter-scaled toughness);
//! * post-failure and never-bonded pairs are the contact solver's jurisdiction (A3
//!   regime table): penalty normal contact plus Coulomb friction, where a failed
//!   pair inherits its dead bond's tribology through
//!   [`CohesiveBond::failed_contact_friction_force`] — the D → 1 continuity
//!   contract, consumed, not re-derived;
//! * the certificate loop is E1's: begin at one resident holon, materialize only
//!   where the damage residual could move the declared observables (projectile
//!   impulse, crack area, detached fragment mass), stop at the coarsest passing
//!   frontier or return `GrainFloor` honestly with the required-vs-available
//!   spacing on the record.
//!
//! ## The two refusal points, and their division of labor
//!
//! The homogenization CONSTRUCTOR refuses a bilinear cohesive law at pitch
//! `h ≥ h_max = 2 G_F (λ+μ)/f_t²` — right for a caller asking for a law to run
//! with. The adaptive CERTIFICATE must still evaluate coarse frontiers so it can
//! convict them, so this module keeps E1's philosophy at the seam: a bond the
//! constructor refuses (or whose quenched weakening closes the softening interval)
//! is built GUARDED — derived elastic stiffnesses, fracture energy floored to keep
//! a positive softening branch — and the solve MEASURES every guarded bond's peak
//! load fraction. A frontier in which any guarded bond carries real load
//! (≥ [`ImpactConfig::guard_fraction`] of its derived peak) has its error bound
//! inflated and cannot certify: the constructor refuses laws, the certificate
//! refuses frontiers, and no coarse frontier can smuggle a guarded bond into a
//! certified answer. Certified corridors are always constructor-legal because the
//! process-zone requirement `ℓ_ch/10` sits far inside `h_max` (their ratio is
//! `2(λ+μ)/E · 10`, ≈ 13–14 for the granites here).
//!
//! Honesty notes: the (k_n, k_t) exactness theorem is for the uniform
//! alternating-diagonal stencil; on the adaptive multi-resolution frontier the same
//! per-relation stiffnesses are applied with the alternating-diagonal selection at
//! the local pitch, and the theorem does NOT reach that case. The convergence gate
//! is what carries the multi-resolution claim — and a second verification pass
//! (research-manager, 2026-08-24) narrows what that can mean, because an earlier
//! wording here said the gate "owns" the claim and that is over-strong. The gate
//! compares three runs of THIS engine against each other; there is no external
//! reference for the composed impact observables on this scene. So it establishes
//! **self-consistency of the certified observables under refinement**, NOT their
//! error against truth — `Core/SelfAudit.lean`'s lesson turned on ourselves: a
//! certificate built from the engine's own data cannot certify the engine's error
//! against the truth. The external anchors this scene does carry are real and are
//! narrower than the claim: momentum balance, the constructor domain `h_max`, and
//! the LAC_DU_BONNET continuum record. **An external reference for these observables
//! is OWED and does not exist; until it does the multi-resolution result is
//! refinement-stable, not verified.** The descriptor's grain-scale draw law remains the
//! Westerly-class demo law even under the LAC_DU_BONNET continuum record: no
//! Lac-du-Bonnet grain-scale law is pinned, so the quenched heterogeneity carries a
//! CLASS warrant only. Contact penalty stiffness/damping and `solver_zeta` are
//! solver configuration named as such (A5). The detached-mass observable is
//! REPORTED but not point-gated: fragment detachment is a threshold event on the
//! quenched crack pattern, which redraws per refinement level (documented
//! materializer behaviour) — T4's regime-C reading applies (fragment quantities
//! are distribution-gated), so the convergence gate stakes impulse and crack area
//! and the measured legs show detached mass flipping between refinement levels
//! (0 / 3.88 / 0 kg on the example scene).
