//! The twin dark-state probe — the crate's one *proved* experiment.
//!
//! Displace the two members of a twin pair in opposite directions,
//! `x = amplitude * (e_a - e_b)/sqrt(2)`, and ask what the other nodes feel.
//!
//! Under a coupling that is symmetric in the pair the answer is **exactly zero**, and
//! it is zero for a reason rather than by cancellation of a fitted parameter:
//!
//! * `DarkState.dark_state_decoupled` — every row `k` outside `{a, b}` annihilates the
//!   mode, because twin symmetry forces `c_ka = c_kb` and the mode's two entries are
//!   equal and opposite. The rest of the graph cannot see the displacement at all.
//! * `DarkState.twin_dark_state` — so the mode is an exact eigenvector with eigenvalue
//!   `-c_ab`, over any commutative ring, sorry-free.
//!
//! That makes criterion (a) below a prediction with no fitted content: the null is a
//! theorem, and a nonzero reading on a structure's symmetrised coupling would mean the
//! symmetrisation is wrong, not that the physics is interesting. None of this depends
//! on `N` — the theorem is about a group average and two indices — so the probe reads
//! the twins off the [`Structure`] and runs at any size.
//!
//! ## How far the measured object is from its own symmetry
//!
//! Under the MEASURED coupling the twins are only approximately twins, so the mode
//! leaks. `Core/DefectCoupling.lean` gives the leak a closed form. Writing
//! `w = e_a - e_b` (so `w . w = 2`) and `D = H - P H P` for the swap reflection `P`,
//! `defect_split` proves
//!
//! ```text
//!   tr(D^2) = 2 (H_aa - H_bb)^2  +  4 * sum_{c not in {a,b}} (H_ca - H_cb)^2
//!                 diagonal split                off-twin defect
//! ```
//!
//! and `trace_defect_sq` proves the dark-to-bright coupling is
//! `g_DB = ||(1 - d dT)(H d)|| = sqrt(tr(D^2)) / (2 sqrt 2)`. Symmetry breaking enters
//! through ONE vector and splits into exactly two parts — a diagonal part and an
//! off-twin part. [`g_db`] is that formula; [`ProbeResult::leakage`] is the same number
//! obtained the physical way, by measuring the residual, and a test checks they agree.
//!
//! ## FINDING: criterion (b) is NOT met by the built-in object's tables, and why
//!
//! The FSD asks for a twin-1 / twin-0 leakage ratio in `[3.0, 4.6]`, from
//! CIRISOntology's measured `g_DB = 2.284` and `8.617` (ratio 3.77,
//! `DefectCoupling.lean` closing note). The tables here give **6.3166** — out of band.
//! Nothing is tuned to hide that; the cause is identified and it is in the data, not
//! in this module:
//!
//! `data::COUPLING` is documented as "symmetrised, **diagonal zeroed**". Zeroing the
//! diagonal deletes the `2 (H_aa - H_bb)^2` term above. The campaign's two twins carry
//! near-identical diagonal splits (3.710 and 3.685) but wildly different off-twin
//! defects (3.552 and 141.729), so that deleted term is **66% of twin 0's** `tr(D^2)`
//! and only **4.6% of twin 1's**. Removing it therefore lifts the ratio from 3.77 to
//! 6.32 — the asymmetry that survives is real, it is just being read without its
//! larger, nearly-equal component.
//!
//! Back-solving confirms the diagnosis rather than assuming it: the diagonal splits
//! implied by the published 2.284 and 8.617, given this crate's off-twin defects, are
//! **3.7098** and **3.6815**, which are the campaign's quoted 3.710 and 3.685 to within
//! 0.1%. Restoring them reproduces `2.28410` and `8.61737`, ratio **3.7728**, inside
//! the band. `campaign_ratio_recovered_when_diagonal_split_is_restored` asserts exactly
//! that, so the shortfall is pinned to a single missing input.
//!
//! **To close it properly**, `data::COUPLING` must ship the diagonal it currently
//! zeroes (or `data.rs` must carry the two splits alongside). That is another agent's
//! file. Until then [`CAMPAIGN_DIAGONAL_SPLIT`] carries the two numbers explicitly,
//! marked as imported constants rather than as anything this crate can derive. It is
//! `[f64; 2]` and not generic: it is a reading about the eleven-kind object, and there
//! is no such reading for any other structure.
