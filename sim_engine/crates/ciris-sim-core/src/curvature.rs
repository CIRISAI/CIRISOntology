//! The first curvature slice: weak-field static metric charts and geodesic motion.
//!
//! ## Where the equivalence principle enters — ONCE, as a premise, cited
//!
//! This module is the single place the equivalence principle enters the engine, and it
//! enters as the METRIC-THEORY PREMISE, not as a theorem: free fall is geodesic motion
//! in the chart
//!
//! ```text
//! ds^2 = (1 + 2 Phi/c^2) c^2 dt^2  -  (1 - 2 Phi/c^2) (dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2)
//! ```
//!
//! (signature (+,-,-,-), matching the T5 chart descriptor; the central chart may carry
//! the second-order `2 beta_ppn (Phi/c^2)^2` term in `g_00` — see [`CentralChart`]).
//! The premise is a GR axiom, not an SR theorem — exactly as DESCRIPTOR_CHAIN.md
//! section 3.5 requires it to be imported (Einstein 1907, the uniform-acceleration
//! equivalence; Will, Living Rev. Relativity 17 (2014) 4, for the modern EEP statement
//! and the PPN bookkeeping). EVERYTHING downstream is derived, not assumed:
//!
//! * the Newtonian limit — geodesics in the uniform chart reproduce `-g zhat` with a
//!   remainder whose leading coefficients are STAKED and measured (2 on `Phi/c^2`,
//!   1/3 on the `g^3 t^4/c^2` term), not just bounded;
//! * universality of free fall — the geodesic equation below contains no mass
//!   parameter AT ALL, so two bodies of any masses follow bit-identical geodesics;
//!   this REPLACES the demo's bolted-on per-body universality check at the foundation
//!   level (the gate is still run, and still mutation-tested with a planted
//!   mass-coupled fifth force);
//! * gravitational time dilation — the thrown-clock closed form
//!   `(tau - T)/T = v0^2/(6 c^2)` (the gravitational term `+g<z>/c^2` minus the SR
//!   term `-<v^2>/(2c^2)` integrated over the ballistic arc);
//! * perihelion precession — `6 pi GM/(a (1-e^2) c^2)` at `beta_ppn = 1`, and the
//!   first-order truncation `beta_ppn = 0` is a planted defect with a PREDICTED
//!   failure signature (ratio 4/3: the precession observable reads `g_00` at second
//!   order, `(2 + 2 gamma_ppn - beta_ppn)/3`).
//!
//! ## The bridge to the demo (the P1 closure statement)
//!
//! `holon-ball-game`'s `CHART_GRAVITY_M_S2 = 1.8` IS the Newtonian limit of
//! [`UniformChart`] `{ g: 1.8 }`: what was a bolted-on chart constant with the
//! equivalence principle entering by citation only is now the certified limit of a
//! geodesic derivation, with the remainder measured here. The game is deliberately NOT
//! modified in this slice; the wiring belongs to the postponed game slice.
//!
//! ## Christoffel symbols, hand-derived (no symbolic machinery)
//!
//! For the static diagonal metric `g_00 = A(x)`, `g_ij = -B(x) delta_ij` in
//! coordinates `x^0 = ct`:
//!
//! ```text
//! Gamma^0_{0i} = A_,i / (2A)
//! Gamma^i_{00} = A_,i / (2B)
//! Gamma^i_{jk} = [delta_ik B_,j + delta_ij B_,k - delta_jk B_,i] / (2B)
//! ```
//!
//! all others zero (static: no d/dt; diagonal: no mixed terms). Derivation of the
//! spatial symbol from `Gamma^i_{jk} = (1/2) g^{ii'} (g_{i'j,k} + g_{i'k,j} - g_{jk,i'})`
//! with `g^{ii} = -1/B`: each `g_{i'j,k} = -B_,k delta_i'j`, so the bracket is
//! `-(B_,k delta_ij + B_,j delta_ik - B_,i delta_jk)` and the `-1/B` flips the sign.
//! The geodesic equation `du^mu/dtau = -Gamma^mu_{ab} u^a u^b` then reads
//!
//! ```text
//! du^0/dtau = -(u^0/A)  (gradA . u_sp)
//! du^i/dtau = -A_,i (u^0)^2/(2B) - [2 u^i (gradB . u_sp) - B_,i |u_sp|^2] / (2B)
//! ```
//!
//! With `A = 1 + 2 Phi/c^2` (+ optional second order) and `B = 1 - 2 Phi/c^2`, the
//! slow-motion coordinate acceleration works out to
//! `zddot = -g(1 + 2 Phi/c^2) + 3 g beta_z^2 + O(2nd order)` in the uniform chart —
//! the `2` from `1/B` (one part space curvature), the `3` as `1 (Gamma^z_zz) +
//! 2 (Gamma^0_{0z} feedback)`. Both coefficients are staked and measured in the gates,
//! and the planted `B == 1` defect (space curvature dropped) shifts them to 0 and 2
//! with predicted signatures.
//!
//! ## Scope and misfits (recorded, not routed around)
//!
//! Free fall only: geodesics of a FIXED external metric. Self-gravity (mass sourcing
//! Phi) stays open under Gantt A3's field-equation half; nothing here sources the
//! metric. Energy bookkeeping: [`energy_per_mass`] is conserved along a geodesic
//! because THIS chart is static (a timelike Killing vector) — it is chart state, not a
//! chart-free total; summing [`crate::relativity::FourMomentum`] entries across
//! separated events in a curved chart is foliation-relative (the M15/L8 landmine) and
//! is deliberately NOT built here.
