//! **The float production floor: entropy this simulator produces because it is made of
//! floats, measured rather than argued.**
//!
//! # Why this quantity and not another
//!
//! `CIRISOntology/Core/Habit.lean` pins the second law in this object's vocabulary, and
//! the load-bearing clause for a *simulator* is that a deterministic step map produces
//! entropy exactly where it fails to be injective —
//! `production_eq_zero_iff_rate_injective`. Velocity Verlet is time-reversible **in exact
//! arithmetic**: negate the velocities, run the same map forward, negate again, and you
//! are back where you started. It is therefore injective, and its entropy production is
//! exactly zero — *as mathematics*.
//!
//! In floats it is not injective, because rounding merges states. **That merging is the
//! only entropy a deterministic simulator has**, and this module counts it: step forward
//! `n`, reverse `n`, and count the initial states that do not come back. The count is a
//! floor on production, in states — the units the theorem is stated in — rather than a
//! proxy in joules or an argument from principle.
//!
//! **Units: nats, with bits in parentheses.** `Core/StochasticHabit.lean` proves
//! `frameEntropy` and Shannon entropy are the same quantity on the uniform-on-fiber state,
//! using `Real.log` — natural log — so nats is the lake's currency and this floor is quoted
//! in it. One merge destroys exactly one bit, and **1 bit = ln 2 = 0.693147… nats**. The
//! measured floor is **0.0514 nats (0.0742 bits)** per ULP-adjacent pair.
//!
//! # Two tolerances, because they are two different measurements
//!
//! Stated explicitly rather than chosen silently:
//!
//! * **exact** — every `f64` of position and velocity returns *bit-identical*
//!   (`to_bits()` equality). This is the one the theorem wants: two states that differ in
//!   any bit are distinguishable, so a step that merges them has destroyed information.
//! * **epsilon** — every component returns within a declared absolute tolerance. This is
//!   the engineering question ("did the trajectory come back?") and it is a *weaker* count:
//!   `not_returned_eps ≤ not_returned_exact` always, since bit-identity implies
//!   within-epsilon.
//!
//! The exact count is the floor. The epsilon count is reported beside it so the gap
//! between "information destroyed" and "visibly wrong" is visible instead of conflated.
//!
//! # What this is NOT
//!
//! A floor, not the production. It counts states that fail to return under **one specific
//! reversal protocol** at one `dt`; a state that returns may still have passed through a
//! merge and come back by luck, so the true production is at least this. It also says
//! nothing about the noisy half of the object — `Habit.lean`'s header is emphatic that
//! `production_nonneg_of_closed` is **false** for stochastic maps, and nothing here is
//! evidence about one.
//!
//! Scope of the reversal: `damping` must be `1.0`. A damped step is not time-reversible
//! even in exact arithmetic — it is a contraction, and measuring its failure to reverse
//! would measure the damping, not the floats. [`float_production_floor`] refuses a damped
//! `Params` rather than returning a number that looks like a floor and is not.
