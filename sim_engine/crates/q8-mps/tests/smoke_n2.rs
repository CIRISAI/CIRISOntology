//! Smoke test, not a staked gate: the two-site sweep engine at N=2 (trivially small, chi=4 is
//! already exact — `chi_l*2` never exceeds 4 on a 4-site chain) against q-seam's exact E0. Run
//! before scaling up to the staked N=8,10,12 gates, on the same "gate immediately" discipline
//! that caught the FINISH-channel bug in G0/G1.
