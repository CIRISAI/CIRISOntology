#    data, twin_probe, quantum_link, curvature, mechanical, gaps, holon, homogenization,
#    structure — one #[test] module per file) never actually ran under this script: gate
#    1 only builds the crate for three targets, it never tests it. ciris-sim-core IS a
#    member of this workspace, so -p reaches it directly (unlike gate 11's two
#    standalone crates, which need --manifest-path).
#
#    --features alloc is NOT optional: the crate's default feature set is EMPTY, and
#    fracture/impact/runtime/descriptor are all `#[cfg(feature = "alloc")]` — measured
#    118 tests default vs 165 under alloc, and ZERO of them fracture::/impact:: either
#    way under default. A plain `-p ciris-sim-core` here ran green while covering none
#    of the adaptive-fracture line (research-manager-2, 2026-08-24) — the gate must name
#    the feature it means to test, not the crate's cheapest build. `std` stays untested
#    by this gate; that is a separate, smaller gap (`--all-features` would close it) and
#    is not what gate 1's no_std build guarantee depends on.
#
#    --release, same reason gate 8 (holon-sandbox) takes it: impact.rs's three-leg
#    convergence test is a float-heavy numeric solver that Rust's debug profile does not
#    optimize, and it is where the suite's cost concentrates (~5 of 165 tests carry it;
#    compilation itself is cheap in either profile). This is a profile argument, not a
#    timing one deliberately — a same-environment debug-vs-release pair was going to be
#    quoted here and got pulled: two readings taken under different, uncontrolled
#    concurrent build load are not a comparison (research-manager-2, on its own numbers,
#    2026-08-24; the same defect it had just caught in an unrelated warm-start probe).
#    Debug-vs-release is a speed knob here, not a correctness one — the assertions are
#    the same either way.
#
#    SELF-VERIFYING, not self-describing (team-lead's ruling): the defect above was a
#    PROSE claim of coverage next to a COMMAND that did not deliver it — "the command
#    exits 0" cannot distinguish "fracture/impact ran and passed" from "fracture/impact
#    were never compiled in", which is exactly how 47 tests and two modules stayed
#    invisible while this gate ran green. `--list` enumerates the test binary's contents
#    without running anything, so a feature-flag regression that silently drops a module
#    fails THIS assertion instead of only living in a comment that nobody re-checks.

# 10. RETIRED 2026-08-27: "the committed viewer wasm IS what the source builds."
#     The Sandbox tab moved out of the published page with the CIRISHolon spin-out,
#     and the committed viewer (html/js/css + wasm binary) left the tree with it —
#     an artifact with no consumer has nothing to gate. The crate, the viewer
#     SOURCE (html/js/css — the crate's contract tests include_str! it, so JS/Rust
#     constant agreement stays gated), the certifier/ledger/solver tests, and the
#     wasm32 build gate all remain; only the committed BINARY left. build-web.sh
#     still builds a local binary (untracked now) for anyone who wants one. The gate's
#     history — the 503-byte counterexample, the cross-machine-delta postmortem, the
#     hermetic-by-construction fix — lives in git at this file, this gate number.

# 11. holon-swarm and holon-mesh each USED TO carry their own empty `[workspace]` table,
#     which made `-p holon-swarm`/`-p holon-mesh` from this root resolve to nothing — no
#     such package existed in this workspace's graph — so neither crate had ever been
#     reached by this script. Both are now real `members` (holon-mesh path-depends on
#     holon-swarm, so cargo refuses two workspace roots in the same graph if only one
#     joins — holon-mesh lane, measured: "multiple workspace roots found"; both joined
#     together, both empty tables removed). Plain -p reaches each directly now. Same
#     shape as gates 7/8: run the tests, then build the release artifact the crate
#     actually ships (a native bin; neither claims a wasm target).
#
#     SELF-VERIFYING (same question asked of gate 9, per team-lead's ruling — "if it can
#     pass while reaching neither crate, it has gate 9's disease"): unlike ciris-sim-core's
#     src-level `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`, these crates' interesting coverage lives in
#     tests/*.rs integration files, whose functions list with BARE names, not a
#     file-derived prefix (measured: tests/determinism.rs and tests/mutation.rs both
#     contribute unprefixed names to `--list`, so a module-prefix grep like gate 9's would
#     not distinguish "reached" from "not reached" here). A nonzero test COUNT is the
#     right assertion for THIS failure mode — "-p resolves to nothing" or "the crate
#     builds but the test binaries collect zero tests" both show up as 0, and unlike an
#     exact count it does not go red every time a test is legitimately added.

# 12. A CROSS-REFERENCE IS A WARRANT ONLY IF ITS TARGET EXISTS (team-lead's ruling,
#     2026-08-24). Q10_PREREG.md §10 cites "M1-M6 carry over from Q9's brief unchanged" —
#     there is no Q9 file anywhere in the repository, so that citation warrants nothing,
#     and nothing here caught it before a human went looking. Prereg/record docs
#     (sim_engine/*.md) cite other artifacts constantly; this gate makes "does the
#     citation resolve" a mechanical fact instead of a claim nobody rechecks.
#
#     THE DISCRIMINATOR (same question gate 11 had to answer for itself): a mention of a
#     filename in prose is not a citation, and a heuristic that cannot tell them apart
#     "looks rigorous and checks nothing". This repo's docs already use two
#     SYNTACTICALLY distinct, unambiguous forms for a real citation — a backtick-quoted
#     path (`` `FILE.md` ``) or a markdown link (`[text](path)`) — never bare prose ("see
#     X" appears nowhere in this corpus, measured). Only those two forms are extracted;
#     everything else is left alone as prose, which is also why "Q9's brief" (bare prose,
#     no literal filename) is NOT and cannot be caught by this gate — that is a real,
#     stated limit, not an oversight: making it catchable requires citing by literal
#     filename, which is exactly the fix this gate incentivizes rather than performs.
#
#     RESOLUTION is a PATH-COMPONENT SUFFIX match against `git ls-files` (the tracked
#     set — what a clean checkout actually has, immune to local untracked clutter),
#     not a literal relative-path resolution: this corpus cites files by bare basename
#     or partial path far more often than by a path resolvable from the citing file
#     (measured: a strict two-basis relative-path resolver flagged 105 "broken"
#     references, of which 94 were real files under a different directory — e.g.
#     `regplus.rs` for `crates/ciris-sim-core/src/regplus.rs`, `Core/ModeChart.lean` for
#     the Lean tree's `CIRISOntology/Core/ModeChart.lean`). A suffix match on path
#     components (not a raw string suffix, so `rt.rs` cannot match `part.rs`) resolves
#     all of those correctly and still catches a genuine miss: a literal `../MISSION.md`
#     does not suffix-match `sim_engine/MISSION.md` (no tracked path contains a literal
#     `..` segment), so a wrong-directory citation is not silently rescued into a pass.
#     Existence only, deliberately: `RESUME.md` resolves against any of nine same-named
#     files in the tree, and this gate does not attempt to pick the right one — that is
#     a real, separate limitation (a citation can resolve to a WRONG same-named file),
#     named here rather than hidden.
#
#     THE ALLOWLIST is per (file, reference), not per filename, and every entry is one of
#     THREE NAMED POLICY CATEGORIES — not an unexplained one-off, so the next reference of
#     a kind already seen is covered by a stated rule rather than re-litigated:
#       1. FOREIGN REPO. FSD_GRAPH_PHYSICS_ENGINE.md declares itself "Repo: CIRISClient" in
#          its own header and cites that OTHER repo's planned files (attract.rs,
#          geometry.rs, plasma.rs, tendrils.rs, ../MISSION.md).
#       2. DEPENDENCY INTERNALS / EXTERNAL ASSET. NL_BRIDGE.md's
#          build.rs/llama.rs/onnx_registry.rs/rten_registry.rs name files INSIDE the
#          llama-cpp-2/rten dependency crates, not this repo; tokenizer.json is a
#          downloaded 11.4MB model asset, deliberately not committed (see
#          chief-of-staff-2's finding on quoted-identity artifacts).
#       3. CROSS-BRANCH PROVENANCE: target verified present on a named branch.
#          MESH_DESIGN.md's M-G11 cites "`JULES_3D_TRIAGE.md` §3.3" as the SOURCE of a
#          finding it already restates inline — not a "go read this" pointer the reader
#          still needs. `git show salvage/jules-3d:sim_engine/JULES_3D_TRIAGE.md` confirms
#          the file exists there; that branch's own header says "Nothing here lands on
#          main... this branch is a parts shelf", so its absence from main is by design,
#          not decay. Team-lead's ruling: the gate's rule is "a cross-reference is a
#          warrant only if its target EXISTS" — it does, just not on this branch — which
#          is a different failure than a citation to something NEVER WRITTEN (Q9's brief,
#          T1's shorthand), and the gate must not conflate them. The citation itself
#          should eventually name the branch inline (mesh's edit to make, tracked
#          separately, not blocking this gate).
#     Scoped per-reference, not globally by filename, so a genuinely missing `build.rs`
#     in some OTHER document is still caught — `build.rs` is too common a real filename
#     to exempt everywhere.
#
#     MESSAGE-ONLY CONTENT IS NOT RECORD: Q10's M1-M6 exist only as an instruction inside
#     agent conversations (named in a board brief, never written to a file), and four
#     Fable-limit deaths today destroyed exactly that kind of content mid-lane. A citation
#     into a lane's conversation is a citation into something that can vanish without
#     warning; a citation into a tracked file is the only kind this gate — or any
#     mechanical check — can ever stand behind.

# 13. EVERY CRATE THE WORKSPACE KNOWS ABOUT MUST HAVE A STATED INVOCATION IN THIS
#     SCRIPT (team-lead's ruling, 2026-08-24), or a documented reason it does not yet.
#     k2-judge went looking for a way to build-verify h3ere2-eval and could not find one
#     here — that absence is the finding this gate closes.
#
#     THE MECHANISM, corrected before landing rather than after (chief-of-staff-2 relayed
#     "`cargo build -p h3ere2-eval` resolves to nothing, not an error" without running it;
#     it does error, loudly, exit 101, `package ID specification did not match any
#     packages` — measured here first). What actually resolves to nothing is the natural
#     BUILD-EVERYTHING command: `cargo build --workspace` exits 0 over a crate `cargo
#     metadata` does not even list, silently, because h3ere2-eval is in `exclude`. `-p`
#     on a name that is not a package always fails loudly; the hazard is a crate nobody
#     ever names at all.
#
#     "REACHABLE" CANNOT MEAN "IN members": four crates are excluded on purpose
#     (engine-compare pulls Rapier and would falsify the core's zero-allocation
#     isolation; wasm-probe and ciris-sim-component each carry their own target/profile
#     configuration a plain `-p` would silently get wrong; h3ere2-eval pulls
#     llama-cpp-2's cmake/C++ build). Forcing them into `members` to satisfy this gate
#     would be exactly the wrong fix -- the isolation gates exist to keep them out. Each
#     is checked via `--manifest-path crates/<dir>/Cargo.toml` from its own directory
#     instead, or exempted with its OWN documented exclude reason if that invocation
#     would need something this script cannot yet supply.
#
#     THE AUDIT uses each crate's real `name =` field, not its directory name -- caught
#     immediately that `crates/wasm-probe`'s package is `ciris-sim-wasm-probe`, which a
#     directory-name check would have missed exactly the way this gate exists to prevent.
#
#     THE FINDING IS BIGGER THAN THE CASE THAT PROMPTED IT: seven crates had zero
#     invocation anywhere in this script. THREE are workspace MEMBERS -- q8-mps, q-seam,
#     sphere-demo -- trivially reachable by a plain `-p` that nobody had ever called. The
#     other FOUR are the excluded set. CRATE_ALLOW is per-crate, dated, and every entry
#     names why, not just that:
#       - q8-mps: DEFERRED. Its grid is live and hours deep; a gate must never run
#         `--ignored` full-grid tests, which are a multi-hour job with no business inside
#         a gate script. Revisit once the grid completes; the eventual entry runs the
#         fast suite only.
#       - q-seam, sphere-demo: uncovered, ownership untriaged (chief-of-staff-2,
#         2026-08-24). q-seam is q8-mps's exact-reference dependency and is real,
#         worth covering once the grid clears.
#       - engine-compare, wasm-probe (pkg ciris-sim-wasm-probe), ciris-sim-component:
#         each crate's OWN documented `exclude` reason in this file's Cargo.toml already
#         states why a naive invocation here would be wrong (std/alloc unification risk;
#         a tri-target profile a plain build would silently misconfigure; a WIT ABI with
#         its own release profile) -- restated per-crate rather than re-litigated.
#
#     h3ere2-eval -- the case that prompted the whole gate -- is NOT in CRATE_ALLOW, and
#     the reason it briefly was is worth keeping: a cold `--manifest-path` build here
#     first reproduced the same E0433/E0599 k2-judge had found from inside the K2 lane
#     (`ciris_nl::chat`/`Session::generate` both called, neither existing), which made a
#     plain "excluded, not yet covered" allowlist reason a lie, while a blocking gate
#     entry would have reddened every OTHER lane's push over a crate none of them touch.
#     Team-lead's ruling on the discriminator, worth restating wherever this pattern
#     recurs: AN ALLOWLIST ENTRY IS LEGITIMATE ONLY WHEN THE BREAK HAS AN OWNER AND AN
#     EXIT; WITHOUT BOTH IT IS SUPPRESSION. The entry that shape produced named k2-judge
#     as owner and "converts to a real invocation the moment the crate builds" as exit --
#     and the exit fired during THIS SAME construction (`71ff2b6`, "the generator was
#     recoverable, and the rebuild is proven byte-identical"), so what ships below is the
#     real gate 13's audit was always meant to end in, not the allowlist entry.

#     found broken during its own construction. `--lib` carries 13 real unit tests
#     (scramble/path/blocks -- weight-multiset, determinism, seeded-path properties),
#     none of them needing model weights; the three `bin/` targets (generate, labelqual,
#     paths) are build-checked by the same command with none filtered out, so a compile
#     break in any of them still fails this gate the way the original hazard needed.
