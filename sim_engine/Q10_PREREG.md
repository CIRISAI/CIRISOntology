# Q10 PREREG — the three-legged certificate at scale, and the refusal it exists to make

**STATUS: DRAFT AGAINST A BRANCH POINT. NOT FROZEN.** The hard prerequisite in §0 is
unresolved, and §1's scope is a function of how it resolves. Nothing in this file is staked
until §0 is discharged and the file is re-committed as FROZEN. Published now for attack, per
freeze-design-early.

## 0. THE HARD PREREQUISITE, AND THE BRANCH

**Q10 cannot be pre-registered on an engine that is *proved* not to report its own manifold's
optimum.** `Core/Stagnation.lean`'s `not_optimal_of_regression` convicts the `chi=256` run at
N=8, U=16 on **two** witnesses — `chi=16` (`δE = 3.411e-5`, converged) and `chi=32`
(`δE = 8.595e-7`, converged) both beat it, and every MPS manifold embeds in every larger one.
The conviction is of the RUN, not of any mechanism. Three mechanisms remain live and none is
supported: rank-deficiency / loss of canonical form, initial-state trapping, and plain
non-convergence.

**The discriminator, named and not yet run:** same configuration, same `chi`, **different
initial state**, through `dmrg::run_from` (which already takes caller-supplied tensors).
Trapping moves or vanishes; conditioning persists. **It must not route through `pad_to_chi`** —
zero-padding manufactures the rank-deficient bonds the conditioning branch blames, and would
confound the contrast it is meant to settle. Team-lead's conditioning instruments
(`‖A†A − I‖` per bond, `⟨ψ|ψ⟩`, per-bond smallest singular value) characterise whichever
branch survives; the initial-state arm is what separates them.

**THE BRANCH, staked now so neither outcome is a surprise:**

- **BRANCH A — the defect is confirmed and fixed.** Q10 proceeds at its full scope (§1A).
- **BRANCH B — canonical form is NOT the cause.** **Q10's scope shrinks to the validated `chi`
  range, and this prereg says so in those words.** Not a smaller claim dressed as the same
  claim: the deliverable is explicitly bounded, and the bound is reported in the headline.

**VALIDATED CHI RANGE — a derived ruler, not a chosen number.** The maximal contiguous range,
starting from the smallest `chi` on the ladder, over which `E(chi)` is non-increasing. This is
`not_optimal_of_regression` used as an acceptance test rather than as a post-hoc conviction:
the first rung that regresses ends the range, and everything above it is out of scope by
theorem rather than by preference. **It is computed before any Q10 gate runs.**

**EMPTY-RANGE CLAUSE.** If the *smallest* `chi` on the ladder already regresses against a smaller
one, the validated range is **empty** and every gate downstream of it is undefined. That is not a
Q10 result: it means §0's prerequisite was not discharged after all, and **Q10 STOPS and returns
to the branch point.** Stated because a ruler with no valid readings is a failure mode a ruler
cannot report about itself.

---

## 1. SCOPE

**1A (Branch A).** `N ~ 100`, or the largest `N` at which the *fixed* engine validates against
`q-seam` at `N ≤ 12` — whichever is smaller. The validation ladder is unchanged from Q8: the
exact reference exists only where `q-seam` reaches, and correctness-against-truth extends only
as far as truth extends.

**1B (Branch B).** The same `N`, restricted to the validated `chi` range of §0. If that range
excludes the `chi` needed to represent the state at `N ~ 100`, **Q10's honest deliverable is
the refusal itself** — see §2.

> **AND HERE IS WHAT WOULD MAKE BRANCH B A FAILURE, named because otherwise every outcome reads
> as a success and that is the shape this whole discipline exists to prevent.** **If the refusal
> fires everywhere — including at configurations where `q-seam` demonstrably validates the engine
> at `N ≤ 12` — then the refusal is useless and BRANCH B HAS FAILED.** A machine that refuses
> unconditionally is `Q_SEAM_RESULTS.md`'s M2 mutant, which was rejected for exactly this. The
> deliverable is a refusal that *discriminates*, and Branch B is judged on discrimination, not on
> having produced a refusal.

**Family.** The 1D Hubbard chain of `Q_SEAM_PREREG.md` §1, half filling, `Sz = 0`, `t = 1`,
open boundaries. **Same family as Q8 deliberately**: this campaign is about the certificate at
scale, not about a new physics family, and changing both at once would make a null
uninterpretable.

---

## 2. THE PRODUCT CLAIM, STAKED IN THESE WORDS

> **The engine refuses to quote when motion is uninformative.**

That is the deliverable. Not "the engine is accurate at N~100" — which it cannot demonstrate,
because no exact reference exists there — and not "the engine quotes its own error", which
**`Core/Stagnation.lean`'s `error_not_computable_from_motion` forbids**: distance-to-truth does
not factor through the process's own motion ledger.

**A certificate of MOTION is not a certificate of ERROR.** Q10 may report where the engine
declines to answer and why; it may not convert a motion or truncation quantity into an error
bar. **G4's retraction (`Q8_MPS_PREREG.md` A4.2) is the measured face of that theorem** and is
cited, not re-derived.

---

## 3. THE THREE LEGS

### 3a. THE FENCE — a wrongness meter computable without a reference

`Q_SEAM_RESULTS.md`'s lesson: `D_bool`, the chart's own cap-not-Boolean fence, tracked chart
failure where the beyond-pair share did not. Q10's analogue must be **chart-internal**, since
at `N ~ 100` there is nothing to compare against.

**STAKED: the fence is the SPECTRUM FLOOR** — the smallest kept singular value relative to the
largest, minimised over bonds: `floor = min_b (s_min(b) / s_max(b))`. A bond whose kept spectrum
still reaches down to near-zero has budget to spare; a bond whose smallest *kept* value is
comparable to its largest has none. **It is not an error estimate and is never reported as one**
(§2); it is the chart's declaration of how close it is to its own limit.

**Threshold: STAKED at `floor ≥ 1e-3` ⇒ the fence is UP.** Chosen, not derived, and declared as
chosen.

> **Why the floor and not bond entropy (ruled 2026-08-24, team-lead; the argument is coherence,
> not robustness).** An earlier draft staked `S_max / ln(chi)` and asserted it "→ 1 as a bond
> exhausts the budget." **That assertion was false**: `S_vN → ln(chi)` requires a *flat* Schmidt
> spectrum, and real MPS spectra decay fast, so a fully saturated bond can read well below any
> ratio threshold — the fence would have read "fine" everywhere for a reason unrelated to the
> chart's health. **The deciding argument is not that the floor is more robust but that it is
> COHERENT with §2 and §5**: the floor is a *production-ledger* quantity, which `Core/Habit.lean`
> licenses reporting as production, whereas an entropy ratio drifts toward exactly the error-bar
> reading this prereg forbids. The entropy ratio is **kept as a reported diagnostic, never as the
> gate.**

### 3b. THEOREM-PINNED ANCHORS — DERIVED FOR THE FAMILY, NEVER ASSUMED

Four, each with its warrant named and each holding at every `N` including where no reference
exists:

| anchor | value | warrant |
|---|---|---|
| particle–hole | `⟨n_jσ⟩ = 1/2` per spin-orbital | `Q_SEAM_PREREG.md` §1.1(iii) — **per spin-orbital, not per site**; the per-site total is 1 |
| magnetization | `m_i = 0` | spin-independence of `H` + ground-state uniqueness in the `Sz = 0` sector (`Q7_SEAM_PREREG.md` §2.2) — **not Lieb**, whose heavier hypotheses this family does not need |
| sector lock | `⟨Ŝz⟩ = 0` **and** `⟨(Ŝz)²⟩ = 0` | A1's pin, and it **earned its keep on first contact**: at N=8, U=16 `⟨Ŝz⟩ = 3.2e-3` would have read as noise while `⟨Ŝz²⟩ = 1.9e-2` convicted, 99.95% of it variance |
| particle number | `⟨N̂⟩ = N` | **conserved by `H`; only APPROXIMATELY realized by an unconstrained variational state** — see the correction below. Drift is unshifted with the **integer** `N_target` (§2 of Q8), never the measured value |

> **The `⟨N̂⟩` warrant is corrected against a measurement already in our own logs.** An earlier
> draft called it exact "by construction". It is not: D1 builds no charge-blocked tensor, so
> nothing in the ansatz enforces particle number, and `output/q8_mps/full_grid_gates.log` records
> `N=8 U=16: |N_tot-8| = 6.9706384007162114e-6` — **over its own 1e-6 band**. "By construction"
> for an unconstrained ansatz is a claim contradicted by our own data, which is why the anchor is
> *gated* rather than assumed: the realization is approximate and the gate is what says so.

**RECORDED COMMITMENT, not a proof, and labelled as such per the house rule on `True`-field
records: if Q10's family is ever changed, every anchor is RE-DERIVED for the new family before
use.** An anchor carried across a family change without re-derivation is an assumption wearing a
theorem's clothes. **Nothing in this file enforces this** — it is a commitment on whoever changes
the family, and if a mechanism is wanted it must be built, not asserted.

### 3c. THE MOTION CERTIFICATE

Two clauses, both refusals:

1. **Across `chi`** — `E(chi)` non-monotone ⇒ **REFUSE**, as the instance of
   `not_optimal_of_regression`. The witness point is realized by the warm start (§4), which is
   what makes the manifold inclusion concrete rather than abstract.
2. **Within a run** — `E(sweep)` non-monotone beyond slack ⇒ **REFUSE**. Q8's G3-primary, as a
   refusal rather than a gate.

---

## 4. WARM START IS SUBSPACE EXPANSION, AND IT IS ONE MECHANISM

**Zero-padding is banned as the growth rule.** A zero-padded bond is rank-deficient by
construction and, on the leading hypothesis, is the disease in a syringe. Growth is by
**subspace expansion** (Hubig, McCulloch, Schollwöck, Wolf — density-matrix / environment-drawn
expansion): new bond directions come from `H` applied to the current state, projected
orthogonally to what is already there, so they are non-null and physically relevant.

**Warm-start and perturbation are ONE mechanism, not two arms** — the expansion IS where the
perturbation enters. **Mutation-tested by removal:** an arm with expansion disabled must be
shown to behave *worse*, or the mechanism is not what is doing the work.

---

## 5. WHAT MAY BE REPORTED, AND AS WHAT

**Discarded weight is a PRODUCTION ledger, never an error.** `Core/Habit.lean`: a chart whose
induced rate map is injective has zero production (`production_eq_zero_iff_rate_injective`,
`production_id_eq_zero_of_injective`), and unitary evolution is injective — so a truncating
quantum simulation's production lives **entirely** in its truncation. Reporting accumulated
discarded weight as *production* is exact and honest. Reporting it as *error* is forbidden by
§2's theorem and was measured false by G4.

---

## 6. GATES

| gate | statement | STAKED threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **H0** validated-`chi` ruler | `E(chi)` non-increasing over the reported range | exact, by theorem |
| **H1** correctness vs `q-seam` | at every `N ≤ 12` in range: energy, density, double-occupancy | Q8's G2 bands, unchanged |
| **H2** anchors | all four of §3b, at **every** `N` including `N ~ 100` | `≤ 1e-6` each |
| **H3** fence separates | the fence must take both values across the sweep | **≥ 1/4 of the grid up AND ≥ 1/4 down** — a FRACTION, because §7 sizes the grid from a cost probe that runs after this file, and an absolute count is demanding on 8 configs and trivial on 40 |
| **H4** refusal fires and discriminates | mutation-tested: `Typed` refuses, `Silent` does not, same numerics | joint, both halves |
| **H5** speed | total wall-clock | §7 |

---

## 7. SPEED IS A STAKED GATE

**TWO thresholds, and the absolute one is why this gate can fail at all.**

1. **STAKED: total wall-clock ≤ 12 HOURS, absolutely.** Calibration, from our own record: Q8's
   superseded run spent **4h39m on seven configurations at `N ≤ 10`** and never reached
   `N=10, U=16`. A grid that cannot fit inside 12 h is a grid that must be made smaller, and this
   ceiling is what forces that decision *before* the run rather than mid-run — which is how
   Amendment 2 happened.
2. **STAKED: total wall-clock ≤ 4× the cost probe's extrapolation.**

> **Clause 2 alone would be a gate that cannot fail**, because the probe sets its own target — the
> same defect as a certificate that quotes its own error. Clause 1 is independent of anything the
> campaign predicts about itself, and it is the one that binds.

The probe is run **before** the grid is fixed, and the grid is sized from it — not the reverse.

**Scheduling is serialized by default** (Q8 Amendment 2's binding rule), and the environment is
probed with one timing under load before any launch. **The two-solve rule applies to every
staked contrast, compute cost included: both arms in ONE run, in ONE environment.** This is not
a formality — a load-average-23 measurement of this campaign's own gate was disowned on
2026-08-24 for exactly this defect, by its author.

---

## 8. THE KILLS — separable, each taking down its own claim

> **K1 CORRECTNESS.** Fires if H1 fails at any validated `N`. Fatal to the deliverable; no
> `N ~ 100` number may be reported. STOP.

> **K2 FENCE.** Fires if H3 fails — the fence reads the same everywhere, or never moves. Kills
> the fence leg only: the anchors and the refusal are untouched. **A fence that never fences is
> decoration**, and this is the clause that says so in advance.

> **K3a ANCHOR UNSOUND.** Fires if any anchor of §3b fails at a configuration where the exact
> reference says the state is right. The anchors are theorem-pinned, so this convicts either the
> derivation or the implementation, and the results file must say which.

> **K3b ANCHOR INERT.** Fires if no anchor fires anywhere across the sweep. An anchor that cannot
> fail on this family certifies nothing here — `Q7_SEAM_RESULTS.md`'s D1b was reported UNTESTED
> rather than null for exactly this reason, and only became a measurement when a family finally
> exercised it.

> *(K3a and K3b were ONE kill in the first draft, which violated the separability rule three
> sections above it. Unsoundness and inertness are different failures with different remedies and
> they get different falsifiers.)*

> **K4 REFUSAL.** Fires if H4's joint condition fails. Kills the refusal feature only; energies
> may still be reported, flagged that undetected non-optimality is unmitigated.

> **K5 SPEED.** Fires if H5 fails. A scheduling and sizing result, not a correctness one.

None implies another. All are reported in the results file's title line, as loudly as a
survival.

## 9. TWO-SOLVE PROBES REQUIRED BEFORE FREEZE

Every staked contrast gets a two-point probe **before** this file is frozen. Non-negotiable,
and the reason is Q7: *"the physics varies along this axis" does NOT imply "the error varies
along it."* Q7 VOIDed at its family gate because nobody measured the spread first.

1. **The fence must be shown to VARY** across the intended sweep — H3's precondition, measured,
   not hoped. If it does not vary, the family does not pose the question and Q10 is
   **VOID-not-killed**.
2. **The anchors must be shown to be violable** — at least one configuration where an anchor
   fires. An anchor that cannot fail on this family proves nothing here.
3. **Cost**: both arms of every timed contrast, one run, one environment (§7).
4. **The §0 discriminator** — different initial state, not through `pad_to_chi`.

---

## 10. CARRIED FORWARD

**M1–M6 ARE DROPPED, and the reason is recorded rather than quietly fixed.** The first draft said
"misfit fixes M1–M6 carry over from Q9's brief unchanged." **There is no Q9 file in this
repository** — `find . -iname "*Q9*"` returns nothing, and the only document in the tree that
mentions M1–M6 is *this one*. It was not a citation to something I had not read; it was **a
citation to a document that was never written**, and message-only content is not record. There is
nothing to carry them over *from*, so they are dropped. If six such fixes exist, they must be
enumerated here in Q10's own words before this file freezes.

*(Third instance today of one shape — T1's "axial P2 / SR+curvature slice" shorthand, the closing
certificate, and now M1–M6: **a cross-reference is a warrant only if its target exists.**)*

**M1–M6, AUTHORED HERE — not recovered, and labelled that way so nobody later reads them as the
originals.** The originals are unrecoverable; these six are written from what this campaign
actually measured on 2026-08-24, each with the incident that produced it, and they bind Q10:

- **M1 — every filter, floor or exclusion is DECLARED in this prereg before it exists in code.**
  Cause: G4's `FLOOR = 1e-14` lived only in `g4_certificate.rs:24` and removed two of five ladder
  rungs from a staked fit. Its provenance was exculpatory (written nine hours before any data) and
  the non-declaration was still a defect.
- **M2 — both arms of every timed contrast run in ONE run and ONE environment.** Cause: a
  release-vs-debug gate timing taken at load 23 and at an earlier load, disowned by its author
  before it hardened into a CI requirement — the same defect this campaign had just caught in an
  unrelated warm-start probe.
- **M3 — a gate is SELF-VERIFYING, never self-describing.** Cause: `ci-gates.sh` gate 9 ran green
  while covering 118 of 165 tests and zero of `fracture::`/`impact::`, with its own comment
  claiming those modules. A gate's scope must be asserted by the gate, not by prose beside it.
- **M4 — a VOID configuration's readings are DIAGNOSTIC, never gate data.** Cause: N=8 U=16 failed
  G2 by six orders while VOID under G7; §7 names G2 in the correctness kill, and the loud reading
  was one sentence from being written down.
- **M5 — a check that cannot distinguish two causes is a DETECTOR: name the discriminator and run
  it before concluding.** Cause: `/proc/<pid>/exe → (deleted)`, sound at launch time and
  false-positive mid-run; and, in this campaign's own physics, a damage non-monotonicity whose
  discriminator (same finest spacing, different frontier extent) was run rather than guessed.
- **M6 — a cross-reference is a warrant only if its target exists**, and message-only content is
  not record. Cause: this very section.

Q8's Amendment 2 scheduling rule,
Amendment 3's VOID-configs-are-diagnostic ruling, and Amendment 4's declaration discipline for
in-code filters all bind here. **Every filter, floor, or exclusion applied to any Q10 fit is
declared IN THIS FILE before it is written in code** — A4's defect, not repeated.

## 12. FILES AND DETACHED COMPUTE

Prereg: this file. Crate: `sim_engine/crates/q8-mps` (extended, not forked). Every run over the
house-rule wall-clock line gets `setsid` + done-marker + `RESUME.md`, and **every detached
launch asserts its binary's provenance at launch time** (`/proc/<pid>/exe` against the build's
mtime — a launch-time assertion, which is where that check is sound; mid-run it is a detector,
not a verdict).
