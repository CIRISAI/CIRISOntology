# Q-SEAM PREREG — the certified meet between an exact quantum reference and a Boolean-occupancy chart

**Frozen 2026-08-23, before any instrument exists.** No crate `q-seam` exists at the time of
this commit; no ground state, no self-consistent field, no error, no share has been computed
for this campaign. Every number below is either (a) an analytic value derived here in closed
form, (b) a threshold or tolerance *chosen* and hereby fixed, or (c) a forward prediction.
Class (b) items are marked **STAKED**; class (c) items are marked **P-**.

The product is not a better quantum solver. The product is a **refusal**: a chart that matches
the exact reference where it is certified to, and declines to speak where correlation makes it
lie. Q5 builds and mutation-tests that refusal. Q6 asks, separably, whether the exact state's
beyond-pair structure predicts *where* the chart fails.

## 0. DEVIATIONS FROM THE COMMISSION, DECLARED UP FRONT

Three, each with its reason. They are deviations, not silent choices.

**D1 — the residual class is not `~1e-15`, and cannot be.** The vacuum tier's `5.6e-17`
(`gauge.rs`, `one_plaquette_vacuum`) is a property of a **3×3** matrix solved by Jacobi to
`JACOBI_TOL = 1e-15`. The reference here reaches Hilbert-space dimension 63 504; its ground
state comes from Lanczos, and its honest residual class is set by that. §3 stakes a **residual
ladder** instead of one blanket figure: bitwise-exact where exactness is available (Hermiticity,
sector conservation, integer counts), `≤ 1e-14` relative where a dense independent solver is
affordable (N ≤ 6), `≤ 1e-12` relative where only Lanczos is (N = 8, 10), and `≤ 1e-11` on the
derived symmetry residuals, which inherit the eigenvector's error. Promising 1e-15 at dimension
6e4 would be a claim I could not cash.

**D2 — the workspace manifest is not touched by this commit.** `sim_engine/Cargo.toml` is a
shared file on a tree with several live agents. Adding `crates/q-seam` to `members` is a
one-line coordination item for the integrator, reported rather than performed. Until then the
crate is built with an explicit `--manifest-path`.

**D3 — N = 12 is out of scope, with the reason.** At N = 12 half filling the Sz = 0 sector is
C(12,6)² = 853 776 states and the Q6 pass is C(24,4) = 10 626 quadruples × 853 776 basis states
≈ 9e9 histogram updates. That is a detached-compute job (§8) for a rung that adds a fifth point
to a four-point trend. It is declared out, not left as an open promise.

## 1. THE REFERENCE FAMILY

**One-dimensional Hubbard chain, open boundary conditions, half filling, Sz = 0.**

```
H = -t Σ_{i=1}^{N-1} Σ_σ ( c†_{iσ} c_{i+1,σ} + h.c. )  +  U Σ_{i=1}^{N} n_{i↑} n_{i↓}
```

with `t = 1` fixing the energy unit throughout. Sector: `N_↑ = N_↓ = N/2`.

**Why this family and not transverse-field Ising** (two sentences, as asked). TFI is a *free*
theory — Jordan–Wigner plus Bogoliubov diagonalizes it exactly at every field, so in the
Bogoliubov mode basis a Boolean-occupancy chart is exact for the entire sweep and the certificate
would be measuring nothing but my choice of basis. The Hubbard chain has no such basis: its
one-body density matrix has strictly fractional natural occupations for every `U > 0`, which is
`Core/ModeChart.lean`'s fence (`meanOcc_fractional_exists`) made physical, and `U/t` is the
correlation knob that carries the chart from exact (`U = 0`) to catastrophically wrong
(`U/t = 16`).

**Why open boundaries.** A periodic ring at half filling with `N ≡ 0 (mod 4)` has a degenerate
open-shell non-interacting ground state — the "ground state" would not be unique, the mean-field
chart would be ill-defined, and every symmetry residual in §3 would be meaningless. The open
chain is closed-shell and non-degenerate at `U = 0` for every even N. This is a known trap and
it is avoided by construction, not by luck.

**The grid — fixed now, 70 configurations.**

- `N ∈ {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}` (Hilbert dimensions 4, 36, 400, 4 900, 63 504).
- `U/t ∈ {0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16}` (14 values, dense at the
  small-U end where the certified boundary is expected to sit).
- **The PLANT** is `U/t = 16` at every N: the sweep's far end, deep in the Mott regime.

### 1.1 Analytic values available in advance (the ruler is gauged before it is used)

House lesson: *gauge a ruler with planted values before staking a band.* Three closed forms are
derived here and become gates in §3.

**(i) The whole `U = 0` column.** Single-particle levels `ε_k = −2t cos(kπ/(N+1))`, k = 1..N.

```
E(U=0) = −4t Σ_{k=1}^{N/2} cos(kπ/(N+1))
Δ(N)  ≡ ε_{N/2+1} − ε_{N/2} = 4t sin( π / (2(N+1)) )        [derived: the sum-to-product identity
                                                              collapses because (2a+1)θ/2 = π/2]
```

| N | dim (Sz=0) | E(U=0)/N/t | Δ(N)/t |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2 | 4 | −1.000000 | 2.000000 |
| 4 | 36 | −1.118034 | 1.236068 |
| 6 | 400 | −1.164653 | 0.890084 |
| 8 | 4 900 | −1.189693 | 0.694593 |
| 10 | 63 504 | −1.205335 | 0.569259 |

The closed form for `Δ(N)` was cross-checked against direct level differences
`ε_{N/2+1} − ε_{N/2}` and agrees to machine precision at all five N; the table is printed to six
decimals and the instrument must reproduce it (G-E7). `Δ(N)` shrinking as `≈ 2πt/(N+1)` is the
mechanism behind every N-dependence staked below: the chart's own denominator gets smaller, so
it breaks at smaller U as N grows.

**(ii) The whole N = 2 column, at every U.** The Hubbard dimer at half filling in Sz = 0:

```
E₀(U) = ( U − √(U² + 16t²) ) / 2
⟨Σ_i n_{i↑}n_{i↓}⟩ = ∂E₀/∂U = ( 1 − U/√(U² + 16t²) ) / 2      [Hellmann–Feynman]
```

So the entire N = 2 row of the sweep — energy and double occupancy at all 14 U values — is
analytically known before the instrument runs, and becomes a full-sweep ruler, not just a
zero-point check.

**(iii) Two exact statements about the exact state that make the plant's failure certain.**
On a bipartite lattice at half filling the particle–hole map `c_{iσ} → (−1)^i c†_{iσ}` is a
symmetry, so `⟨n_{iσ}⟩ = 1/2` exactly at every site, every spin, every U. And by **Lieb's
theorem** (PRL 62, 1201 (1989)) the half-filled bipartite Hubbard ground state has total spin
`S = |N_A − N_B|/2 = 0` and is unique up to spin degeneracy — so `m_i ≡ ⟨n_{i↑} − n_{i↓}⟩ = 0`
exactly, at every site, every U. A mean-field chart that breaks spin symmetry therefore reports
a magnetization the exact state provably does not have. **The plant's chart failure is not
hoped for; it is a theorem.**

---

## 2. THE CLASSICAL CHART

**A single Slater determinant — Boolean occupancy over spin-orbital modes, exactly
`Core/ModeChart.lean`'s `OccState M`.** Spin-unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF):

```
F_{iσ} = h + U · diag( n_{i,−σ} ),      n_{iσ} = Σ_{p ∈ occ_σ} |φ^σ_p(i)|²
```

self-consistent, filling the lowest N/2 orbitals per spin. The chart's one-body density matrix
is idempotent by construction — its mode occupations are exactly `{0,1}`, which is precisely why
the chart *cannot see its own fractionality*, and why §4's certificate must be built from
something other than those occupations.

**Determinism, fixed now.** Three initial guesses — uniform (`n_{iσ} = 1/2`), Néel
(`n_{iσ} = 1/2 ± 0.25(−1)^i`), and a fixed-seed pseudorandom guess (seed `0x5EAM`, stated) —
each run to convergence with linear mixing `α = 0.3`, stopping at `max_{iσ} |Δn_{iσ}| ≤ 1e-12`,
cap 5 000 iterations. **The chart is the lowest-energy converged solution of the three.** No
adaptive restarts, no tuning; a configuration where none of the three converges is VOID and is
reported as VOID, never as a refusal.

### 2.1 The observable set — FIXED NOW, six entries, no additions

| # | Observable | Chart prediction | Exact | Tolerance τ (**STAKED**) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| O1 | energy per site, `e = E/(N t)` | `E_UHF/(N t)` | `E₀/(N t)` | `0.02` |
| O2 | double occupancy per site, `d = (1/N)Σ_i ⟨n_{i↑}n_{i↓}⟩` | `(1/N)Σ_i n^MF_{i↑} n^MF_{i↓}` | exact expectation | `0.02` |
| O3 | site occupation, `max_i \|Δn_i\|`, `n_i = ⟨n_{i↑}+n_{i↓}⟩` | `n^MF_{i↑}+n^MF_{i↓}` | `= 1` exactly (PH) | `0.02` |
| O4 | magnetization, `max_i \|Δm_i\|`, `m_i = ⟨n_{i↑}−n_{i↓}⟩` | `n^MF_{i↑}−n^MF_{i↓}` | `= 0` exactly (Lieb) | `0.05` |
| O5 | bond order, `max_i \|Δb_i\|`, `b_i = Σ_σ ⟨c†_{iσ}c_{i+1,σ}+h.c.⟩` | from `ρ^MF` | exact expectation | `0.02` |
| O6 | Boolean defect, `D_bool = max_p min(n_p, 1−n_p)` over natural occupations of the spin-resolved 1-RDM | `0` exactly (idempotent) | exact 1-RDM spectrum | `0.05` |

O6 **is** the ModeChart fence as a number: the chart says every mode is determinate; the exact
state says how wrong that is.

**A configuration is CHART-HONEST iff all six are within tolerance.** The tolerance vector is
fixed here and is never revisited. Note the self-limiting structure that protects it from being
gamed: *loosening* a tolerance enlarges the honest set and makes certify-everywhere **harder**
to beat, so a permissive tolerance costs me, it does not help me.

**Normalized error.** `E_tot ≡ max_o ( |error_o| / τ_o )`, in units of tolerances. `E_tot ≤ 1`
is exactly chart-honest. `E_tot` is the single error number used by Q6.

---

## 3. EXACTNESS GATES — numeric, staked, and run BEFORE anything downstream

Nothing in §4–§6 is computed for a configuration that has not passed §3. A gate failure makes
the configuration VOID (excluded and reported as excluded), never a refusal and never a datum.

| Gate | Statement | **STAKED** threshold |
|---|---|---|
| G-E1 | Hamiltonian Hermiticity, `max\|H−Hᵀ\|` | **exactly 0.0** (bitwise) |
| G-E2 | every matrix element connects identical `(N_↑,N_↓)` | **0 violations** (integer) |
| G-E3 | fermionic signs: bit-trick construction vs. an independent explicit Jordan–Wigner build at N = 2, 4 | `≤ 1e-15` max element |
| G-E4a | eigen-residual `‖Hv−E v‖₂ / (‖v‖₂ · max(1,\|E\|))`, N = 8, 10 | `≤ 1e-12` |
| G-E4b | N ≤ 6: independent dense Jacobi vs. Lanczos, `\|ΔE\|/\|E\|` | `≤ 1e-14` |
| G-E4c | the crate's dense solver validated against `ciris_sim_core::linalg::jacobi_eigen` on 3×3/4×4 fixtures | `≤ 1e-14` |
| G-E5a | particle–hole residual `max_{iσ} \|⟨n_{iσ}⟩ − 1/2\|` | `≤ 1e-11` |
| G-E5b | spin-flip residual `max_i \|m_i\|` | `≤ 1e-11` |
| G-E5c | reflection residual `max_i \|⟨n_i⟩ − ⟨n_{N+1−i}⟩\|` | `≤ 1e-11` |
| G-E5d | total spin `\|⟨S²⟩\|` | `≤ 1e-10` |
| G-E6 | non-degeneracy `E₁ − E₀` within the sector, reported per configuration | `≥ 1e-6 t` |
| G-E7 | `U = 0` column against §1.1(i) closed form, and every chart error at `U = 0` | `≤ 1e-12` rel. / `≤ 1e-12` |
| G-E8 | N = 2 column, all 14 U, against §1.1(ii) closed forms (E and d) | `≤ 1e-12 t` |
| G-C1 | SCF convergence `max_{iσ}\|Δn_{iσ}\|` | `≤ 1e-12` |
| G-C2 | chart 1-RDM idempotency `‖ρ²−ρ‖_max` — Booleanity **checked, not assumed** | `≤ 1e-12` |
| G-C3 | variational sanity `E_UHF ≥ E₀` | `≥ −1e-10` |

G-E5b deserves a note: it is *both* an exactness gate on the reference *and* the exact side of
observable O4. The same theorem that certifies the solver is the one that convicts the chart.

---

## 4. THE CERTIFICATE — two candidates, thresholds fixed before any error exists

Both are **computable from the chart's own data alone**. Neither reads the exact state. This is
the whole point: a certificate that needs the answer certifies nothing.

### C1 — the self-audit (the substantive candidate)

The chart estimates its own error in each observable to leading order in `U`, using
second-order (MP2-style) amplitudes over its **own** converged orbitals `{φ^σ_p, ε^σ_p}`:

```
t_{ia,jb}^{σσ'} = ⟨ij|ab⟩ / ( ε_i^σ + ε_j^{σ'} − ε_a^σ − ε_b^{σ'} )
```

from which come `Ê₂` (correlation energy), `d̂₂`, `n̂₂`, `m̂₂`, `b̂₂`, and `D̂₂` (the leading
occupation-number correction, i.e. the chart's own prediction of the ModeChart fence quantity).

> **C1: CERTIFIED iff `|estimate_o| ≤ κ · τ_o` for all six observables, with κ = 0.5.**
> **STAKED: κ = 0.5** — certify only when the chart's own estimate of its error is at most half
> the tolerance. This is the T2 discipline (a gate that consumes its own reference bias)
> transplanted: the safety factor is the stake, and if MP2 is wrong in sign or magnitude the
> FP gate in §5 will convict it.

### C2 — the stability margin (the cheap structural rival)

`λ_min(N,U)` = the lowest eigenvalue of the chart's Thouless stability matrix (Thouless, Nucl.
Phys. 21, 225 (1960)) over both the spin-conserving and spin-flip blocks — how far the converged
determinant is from a saddle.

> **C2: CERTIFIED iff `λ_min(N,U) ≥ 0.5 · λ_min(N,0)`.**
> **STAKED: factor 0.5**, self-normalizing against the same N's non-interacting stability, so no
> free energy scale is introduced. At `U = 0`, `λ_min(N,0) = Δ(N)` from §1.1(i).

**P-C2-FAIL (a forward prediction about the instrument, staked so the outcome is informative
either way).** I predict **C2 fails the plant-refusal gate at large U**. Reason, stated now:
past the Coulson–Fischer point (Coulson & Fischer, Phil. Mag. 40, 386 (1949)) the UHF solution
breaks spin symmetry and becomes *stable again* on the broken branch, so `λ_min` can recover
above threshold in exactly the Mott regime where O4 is a pure lie. If C2 nonetheless refuses the
plant, that prediction is wrong and I will say so in the title line of the results.

**No third candidate will be introduced after data exist.** Two is the cap and this is it.

---

## 5. THE GATES, AND THE MUTATION TEST

### 5.1 Classification

Per configuration, given a criterion and the §2.1 tolerance vector:

| | chart honest (`E_tot ≤ 1`) | chart wrong (`E_tot > 1`) |
|---|---|---|
| **certified** | TP | **FP — the certificate lying. Fatal.** |
| **refused** | FN (conservative; costs coverage) | TN |

### 5.2 The joint gate — a criterion PASSES iff all four hold

1. **`FP = 0`.** Not "few". Zero. A certificate that ever certifies a wrong chart is dead.
2. **`coverage ≡ TP/(TP+FN) ≥ 0.50`** over chart-honest configurations. This is what
   refuse-everywhere cannot buy.
3. **Every `U = 0` configuration certified** (5 of them). A criterion that refuses the case
   where the chart is provably exact is broken, not conservative.
4. **The PLANT refused**: `U/t = 16` refused at every N (5 of them).

### 5.3 The mutants — RUN and REPORTED, never asserted

| Mutant | Definition | Expected fate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M1** certify-everywhere | always certify | fails (1) and (4) by construction | kill-relevant |
| **M2** refuse-everywhere | always refuse | fails (2) and (3) | kill-relevant |
| **M3** best fixed cutoff | certify iff `U/t ≤ u*`, `u*` chosen **post hoc to be optimal**, every advantage given | reported | severity baseline |
| **M4** best scaling cutoff | certify iff `U/t ≤ a + b/(N+1)`, `(a,b)` fitted **post hoc** | reported | severity baseline |

M1 and M2 are the commission's mutation test and both must be *shown* to fail, in the results,
with their numbers. M3 and M4 are my own adversaries: if a post-hoc-tuned cutoff on the sweep
parameter matches a chart-internal criterion, the criterion is *correct but uninformative*, and
§7 fixes in advance that this is what I will report.

**P-Q5-N (staked forward prediction about the certified region).** If C1 is doing real work
rather than reading `U` in disguise, its certified boundary must **shrink with N**, because
`Δ(N)` shrinks (§1.1(i)). Staked: `U*_certified(N)` is non-increasing in N across
`N = 2,4,6,8,10`, with `U*(2) / U*(10) ≥ 2.0`. A flat boundary would mean C1 is a fixed-U cutoff
wearing a lab coat.

### 5.4 KILL — Q5, separable, stated absolutely

> **The Q5 kill FIRES iff neither C1 nor C2 passes all four clauses of §5.2.**
> Then the certificate is decoration: record DEAD, keep marked, and say so in the title line.
> The kill is stated absolutely rather than relative to M1 because M1 fails clauses (1) and (4)
> by construction — "beats certify-everywhere" would be too weak a bar and I am not taking it.

This kill takes down the certificate and **nothing else**. It does not touch Q6, does not touch
`Core/ModeChart.lean`, and makes no claim about mean-field theory in general — only about
whether *these two staked criteria* on *this family* separate honest from lying.

---

## 6. Q6 — THE SHARE AS THE FAILURE INSTRUMENT (separable, prereg'd here, own kill)

Q6 reads **only the exact state**. It never touches the chart's data, so its verdict is
independent of Q5's.

### 6.1 The statistic, and a derivation done before the instrument exists

Slots: the `2N` Boolean spin-orbital occupancies `x_{iσ} = n_{iσ} ∈ {0,1}`. The exact ground
state gives an exact probability distribution over Fock-basis strings, `P(x) = |ψ(x)|²`.

> **Named honestly, once:** this is a **classical statistic of a quantum state** — the Fock-basis
> measurement distribution. It is not a quantum-sector reading and will not be described as one.

**Primary statistic — `B4`, the beyond-pair information of a 4-slot marginal:**

```
B4(Q) = D( P_Q ‖ Q_maxent )  =  H(Q_maxent) − H(P_Q)      [nats]
```
where `Q_maxent` is the maximum-entropy distribution on the 16 cells matching all 1- and
2-marginals of the quadruple `Q`. Aggregate: **`B4_mean`**, the mean over **all** `C(2N,4)`
quadruples (4 845 at N = 10; the full grid, because *the equally-spaced diagonal is provably
blind* — house lesson, and there is no sampling cost here to justify a subset).

**Primary predictor: `ΔB4 = B4_mean(N,U) − B4_mean(N,0)`.** Justified, not patched: at `U = 0`
the state is a Slater determinant, whose Fock-basis distribution is a determinantal process with
genuinely non-pairwise structure, and the fixed `Σ_i x_{iσ} = N/2` constraint adds more (*a
global linear constraint on the slots manufactures higher-order structure* — house lesson, named
here before it can be discovered as a surprise). All of that is structure the chart handles
**exactly**. Subtracting the `U = 0` column removes exactly the part that is not correlation.
`B4_mean` raw and `B4_mean/B4_mean(0)` are **declared secondaries that cannot change the verdict.**

### 6.2 The plumb line — a theorem-predicted machine zero, derived here

The ground state is unique in the `(N/2,N/2)` sector and particle–hole symmetric, so
`P(x) = P(x̄)` under global complement. Marginalizing preserves that. On **three** slots:
complement symmetry leaves `p_{000}=p_{111}, p_{001}=p_{110}, p_{010}=p_{101}, p_{100}=p_{011}`
— 3 free parameters after normalization; and it forces all three fields of the pair-maxent
family to vanish, leaving exactly 3 couplings to match exactly 3 pair marginals (the 1-marginals
are all 1/2 and carry no information). Parameter count matches constraint count, so
`Q_maxent = P` exactly:

> **`I_C^(3) ≡ 0` on every configuration of this family, exactly.**

On **four** slots the same count gives 7 free parameters against 6 couplings — one residual
degree of freedom, which is precisely `B4`. This is why the primary statistic is at k = 4 and
not k = 3, and it is consistent with the programme's sign-symmetry result (odd orders killed,
even orders survive from four slots up).

> **G-Q6-PLUMB (STAKED): the instrument must read `|I_C^(3)| ≤ 1e-12` at every configuration.**
> A failure here means the estimator is broken and **Q6 is VOID, not falsified** — no verdict
> until repaired. This is the Planck-plumb-line move: a column whose exact value is known in
> advance validates the pipeline.

### 6.3 Estimator and its gates

Exact marginals from the wavefunction — **no sampling**, so there is no finite-N floor, no
permutation floor for the estimator, no tie fraction, and no `b ≥ 3` binning anywhere (the slots
are natively binary). The floor here is numerical, not statistical, and saying so is a real
advantage of using an exact reference.

- Solver: Newton on the 10 dual parameters (4 fields, 6 couplings) of the pair-maxent family.
- **G-Q6-1 (STAKED): max marginal residual `≤ 1e-13`.** A quadruple that fails is VOID and
  counted; if `> 20%` of quadruples are VOID at a configuration, that configuration's `ΔB4` is
  VOID and reported as such.
- **No data-dependent exclusion.** Quadruples are never dropped for having small cell
  probabilities — only for solver non-convergence. (The Mott end drives cells like
  `n_{i↑}=n_{i↓}=1` toward zero; the min-cell-probability distribution is reported as a
  diagnostic, not used as a filter.)
- Entropies accumulated in log space with Kahan summation (*near-ceiling numerics* lesson).

### 6.4 The staked predictions

The naive test — "`ΔB4` correlates with chart error across the sweep" — is nearly a tautology,
since both rise with `U`. *A residual is never support.* So the sweep's **second axis** carries
the test: chart error at fixed `U` grows with `N` (via `Δ(N)`), and a genuine instrument must
track that too. Q6 statistics use `N ∈ {4,6,8,10}` (N = 2 has exactly one quadruple and is
excluded from aggregates; stated now).

- **P-Q6-A (the across-N test).** Partial Spearman `ρ_s( ΔB4 , E_tot | U/t ) ≥ +0.50` with
  `p < 0.01` under a **within-U-column permutation null** — permute the `ΔB4` labels among the
  four N values *inside each U column*, 10 000 draws, exact p reported. This null preserves the
  U-monotone structure exactly and tests only the across-N information, which is the claim.
  **p is quoted, not z** (house rule; and the null's shape is reported before the p).
- **P-Q6-B (the collapse).** Isotonic regression of `E_tot` on `ΔB4` has median absolute residual
  `≤ 0.70 ×` that of isotonic regression of `E_tot` on `U/t`, over all 56 configurations. Same
  estimator class both sides, so the comparison is like-for-like.
- **P-Q6-C (the boundary — the sharpest).** Evaluate `ΔB4` at each N's **last chart-honest**
  configuration. If `ΔB4` is a genuine instrument these are one critical value; if it is a
  thermometer they are four different ones. Staked: **coefficient of variation across the four
  N values `≤ 0.35`.**

### 6.5 KILL — Q6, separable, its own

> **The Q6 kill FIRES iff any of:**
> (a) `ρ_s < 0.20` or `p > 0.05` in P-Q6-A; **or**
> (b) `ΔB4 ≤ 1e-10` (numerical floor) at any configuration with `E_tot ≥ 3` — share at floor
>     where the chart is badly wrong; **or**
> (c) `ΔB4 ≥` the median of the chart-honest configurations' `ΔB4`, at any configuration with
>     `E_tot ≤ 0.5` — large share where the chart is fine.
>
> Firing kills **instrument-as-certificate** and touches nothing in Q5, nothing in the stance.

---

## 7. THE MEANING OF EVERY OUTCOME — fixed before any result

Nothing below may be renegotiated after data exist.

### Q5

- **(a) C1 passes §5.2, M1 and M2 fail, and C1's coverage exceeds M3's.** The certified seam is
  real and earns its structure: a chart auditing itself from its own data separates honest from
  lying better than reading the sweep parameter. This is the deliverable.
- **(b) C1 passes §5.2 but M3 (or M4) matches or beats its coverage.** The certificate is
  **correct but uninformative** — the refusal is sound, and the chart-internal *warrant* is not
  supported, because a post-hoc cutoff on `U` does the same work. Reported in exactly those
  words, in the title line. Not a kill, not a success, and no rescue by adding a third criterion.
- **(c) C1 fails `FP = 0`, C2 passes §5.2.** C1 dead (with the FP-producing observable named);
  the surviving certificate is the structural stability margin, and **P-C2-FAIL was wrong** —
  said as loudly as a confirmation.
- **(d) Neither passes.** **Q5 KILL FIRES.** The certificate is decoration on this family with
  these criteria. Record dead, keep marked. What survives is the exact reference and its gate
  ladder, which is reusable.
- **(e) A criterion refuses `U = 0`.** That criterion is broken, not conservative; reported as a
  construction defect, and it fails clause (3) regardless of its other numbers.
- **(f) The honest set is empty — even `U = 0` is out of tolerance.** Impossible by G-E7
  (mean field is exact at `U = 0`). Observing it means the instrument is broken: **VOID, not a
  kill.**
- **(g) The honest set is everything — even `U/t = 16` is within tolerance.** Impossible by
  Lieb's theorem via O4 (§1.1(iii)). Observing it means the instrument is broken: **VOID, not a
  kill.**
- **(h) P-Q5-N fails — C1's certified boundary does not shrink with N.** C1 is a fixed-U cutoff
  in disguise; report it as such even if C1 passes §5.2, and read outcome (b).

### Q6

- **(a) P-Q6-A, B and C all confirmed.** The beyond-pair share of the exact state predicts where
  the Boolean chart fails, on this family, in a way that survives controlling for the sweep
  parameter. Scope: **one model family, N ≤ 10, 1D, half filling.** No wild claim, no stance edit
  from this file — findings go to the integrator (research first, then stance).
- **(b) A confirmed, B and/or C fail.** The share is a **thermometer, not an instrument**: it
  rises with `U` alongside the error and carries no independent information about where the chart
  breaks. Reported as NOT support.
- **(c) Any kill clause in §6.5 fires.** Instrument-as-certificate is dead, marked, separable —
  Q5's verdict stands untouched whatever it is.
- **(d) G-Q6-PLUMB fails (`|I_C^(3)| > 1e-12`).** The estimator is broken: **Q6 VOID**, no
  verdict at all, and the first hypothesis to check is my §6.2 parameter count, not the physics.

### Both

- **Any §3 gate failing at a configuration** makes that configuration VOID. If more than 10 of
  the 70 configurations are VOID, the campaign is reported as **UNDERPOWERED** and neither kill
  is adjudicated — a kill may not fire on an instrument that could not run.

## 8. HOUSE GATES CARRIED

1. **Pre-registration.** This file, committed before the crate exists. Every threshold marked
   **STAKED** and every prediction marked **P-** is frozen at this commit.
2. **Separable kills.** Q5's kill (§5.4) touches the certificate only. Q6's kill (§6.5) touches
   the instrument only. Neither touches the reference, `Core/ModeChart.lean`, or the stance.
3. **Null matched to the generative structure.** §6.4's null permutes within U columns, because
   the U-monotone co-trend is the confound. No iid null anywhere.
4. **No `b ≥ 3` binning.** Slots are natively Boolean.
5. **p, not z** (§6.4), with the null's shape reported before the p.
6. **A residual is never support.** P-Q6-A/B/C are advance predictions with thresholds fixed
   here; a post-hoc-fitted trend would be reported as fitting, never as confirmation.
7. **Fired kills reported as loudly as survivals**, in the title line of `Q_SEAM_RESULTS.md`,
   with the dead criterion kept and marked.
8. **Named denominators.** "coverage" is over chart-honest configurations only; "70
   configurations" is 5 N × 14 U; Q6 aggregates are over 56 (N ≥ 4).
9. **Received numbers.** Every number in this file is derived here in closed form (§1.1) or is a
   stated choice. Nothing is taken from a sibling agent unverified.
10. **Detached compute.** No run here is expected to exceed minutes (worst case: 63 504-dim
    Lanczos, then 4 845 quadruples × 63 504 basis states ≈ 3e8 accumulations). **If any run
    exceeds 5 minutes it is relaunched under `setsid` with a done-marker and a `RESUME.md`**, per
    the standing rule. N = 12 is out of scope (§0/D3).
11. **Shared-tree hygiene.** Commits use pathspec only (`git commit -- <files>`), never bare
    `add`+`commit`. `sim_engine/Cargo.toml` is not touched by me (§0/D2).
12. **No stance or Lean edits.** Findings return to the integrator to cash.

## 9. PRIOR ART — credited generously, because the borrowed parts are borrowed

*Convergence findings are hits, not strikes.* Nothing in §1, §2 or §6.1's estimator is new:

- **Hubbard chain, exact solution**: Lieb & Wu, PRL 20, 1445 (1968). Half-filled bipartite
  ground-state spin: Lieb, PRL 62, 1201 (1989).
- **Mean-field symmetry breaking**: Coulson & Fischer, Phil. Mag. 40, 386 (1949). **Stability
  analysis**: Thouless, Nucl. Phys. 21, 225 (1960); Seeger & Pople, JCP 66, 3045 (1977).
- **Natural occupation numbers as the correlation measure**: Löwdin, Phys. Rev. 97, 1474 (1955).
- **Connected information / beyond-pair maxent**: Schneidman, Still, Berry & Bialek, PRL 91,
  238701 (2003); Amari, IEEE TIT 47, 1701 (2001). The `k=3` share as a contingency-table deviance
  is Bartlett (1935).

**What is not borrowed, and is the actual deliverable:** the *certificate* — a refusal criterion
computable from the chart's own data, staked before the instrument existed, mutation-tested
against certify-everywhere and refuse-everywhere, and adversarially compared against a
post-hoc-optimal cutoff. Everyone measures mean-field error; the product here is the machine
declining to speak.

## 10. KNOWN HOLES — not gated, and said now rather than discovered later

1. **Tolerances are chosen, not derived.** §2.1's τ vector has no first-principles warrant. The
   protection is structural (§2.1's self-limiting note, and `FP = 0` being unforgiving), not
   principled. A reader who rejects the τ vector rejects the whole Q5 reading, and that is fair.
2. **One family.** Every Q5 and Q6 statement is scoped to the 1D open Hubbard chain at half
   filling, N ≤ 10. Doping, two dimensions, and long-range interaction are untested and will not
   be spoken about.
3. **`κ = 0.5` and the `0.5·λ_min(N,0)` factor are single points**, not scans. Scanning them
   after seeing errors would be tuning; they are fixed here and stay fixed.
4. **MP2 over UHF orbitals is not size-consistent with the broken-symmetry branch** in the usual
   textbook sense, and its estimates past the Coulson–Fischer point may be poor. That is a
   *reason C1 might fail*, and it is named in advance rather than offered afterwards as an excuse.
5. **Q6 says nothing about wild systems.** It is a classical statistic of a model quantum state.
