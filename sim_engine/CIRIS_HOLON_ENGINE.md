# CIRISHolon engine

Status: executable architectural slice, not a claim of complete multi-regime dynamics.
Date: 2026-08-22.

The governing WHY is [`MISSION.md`](MISSION.md).
This PR is the **Newton realization**. Einstein begins only after the classical trajectory,
contact, adaptive-grain, WASM, and rendered-pipeline gates below pass.

## Contract

There is one recursively closed holon type. A person, NPC, ball, storyline, and quark
are not different storage variants; they are the same recursively compositional holon.
Typed realizations are executable charts over that common maximal choice object, not
replacement ontologies.
`Holon` names the whole/part primitive; `root holon` names its role in one evaluation.
There is no absolute maximal holon. A root can become a child when a larger holarchy is
formed. In CEWP, the current root-scale realization is a **Constitutional Mesh**.

A holon contains:

- additive REG+ gross state;
- irreducible whole-state that is not required to factor through its children;
- zero or more simultaneous dynamical channels;
- a boundary marker;
- a grain diameter in multiples of `g0`;
- a decomposition state: terminal, latent, or resident.

## Representational closure

“Quark to storyline” is not a metaphor and does not mean one classical force law is
stretched across unrelated regimes. The closure is stronger and cleaner: every variation
of a holon is represented in the same maximal choice object already mechanized in
`Core/Generator.lean` and `Core/WrongKind.lean`:

- Priorities, Rules, Manner, Identity, Confidence, Facts, Circumstances, Process, Model,
  Structure, and Premises are the eleven artifact-local coordinates;
- Record is the relation between a holon and the frame from which its history can still be
  established;
- warrant/source is an orthogonal coordinate, not another entity class;
- the CEG/REG+ operations act on that common representation;
- recursive composition and whole-only state preserve what partial views cannot recover.

Mechanical, quantum, agentic, and narrative are therefore not sovereign ontologies with
unrelated state spaces. They are **realizations or charts of the same holon**: declarations
of which common coordinates are active, how host observations enter them, which observables
are read out, and how an approximation is certified. If a purported realization needs a
degree of freedom that cannot embed in the maximal object, that is a measured no-fit against
representational closure—not permission to bolt on a second object model.

What remains domain-sensitive is operational rather than metaphysical: an executable update
operator, an observation/readout map, and an error certificate must be supplied or derived
before that realization can produce numerical trajectories. Those are implementations of the
shared holon under a declared regime. They are not independent ontologies that define a quark,
person, or storyline as a different kind of being.

The arena is a **resident refinement window**, not the whole ontology. Latent holons
represent recursively implied children without enumerating them. An expanded holon is
accepted only when its resident children compose exactly to its REG+ gross state.

Two storage policies execute the same mathematics:

- `HolonArena<CAP, W>` is the allocator-free, compile-time path for sealed scenes and
  very small WASM/embedded deployments;
- `RuntimeArena` is the `no_std + alloc` path for CIRISGame-style browser/native hosts.
  It uses 56-byte fixed-width holon headers, one contiguous header vector, one flat
  variable-width whole-state pool, `u32` holon IDs, and a 64-holons-per-word frontier.

The runtime path therefore does not choose one universal whole-state width and does not
allocate one `Vec` per person, quark, storyline, or boundary element. A reusable
`RuntimeFrontier` makes repeated certifications allocation-free after scene construction.
Latent branches can be materialized transactionally: child IDs append without
invalidating existing handles, and no mutation commits unless the children have valid
depth/grain and compose exactly back to the parent REG+ ledger.

## Mathematics carried into the runtime

`regplus.rs` reproduces `Core/Lattice.lean`'s six-direction object directly. Its tests
enumerate all 64 local states and recover exactly 53 `(N,P)` sectors with dimensions
`44 × 1`, `7 × 2`, and `2 × 3`. Gross occupancy and momentum then compose additively
through arbitrary recursive holons. A transition can be checked for sector preservation;
no collision law is smuggled into that check.

Whole-state is stored separately. Consequently, requiring children to balance the REG+
ledger does not assert that the parent is computable from partial views.

## Gross plus boundary

Realization-specific mathematics implements `BoundaryModel`. It evaluates the current
frontier, supplies a normalized macroscopic error bound and conservation residual, and
ranks boundary holons for refinement. The selector begins at the encounter root and
returns the first frontier satisfying both tolerances. Failure at `g0` is reported as
`GrainFloor`; unavailable resident children are reported as `RefinementUnavailable`.

The first concrete realization is `SphereContactModel`. It deliberately demonstrates the
architecture's split:

- arbitrarily large object counts and unequal masses stay in the gross calculation;
- exact restitution supplies the aggregate contact impulse;
- deterministic Fibonacci boundary samples approximate the contact surface;
- only contact-side branches refine;
- an analytic sphere supplies the error bound and contact-time reference.

Run it with:

```sh
cargo run -p ciris-sim-core --example recursive_holons
```

The example represents a one-million-element person and a 64,000-element NPC in a
15-holon resident window. Mechanical contact is only one realization attached to those
holons; both also carry narrative and agentic channels.

The runtime-sized version begins with only the encounter, person, and NPC resident. A
procedural materializer then instantiates only branches requested by the certificate:

```sh
cargo run -p ciris-sim-core --example runtime_materialization --features alloc --release
```

It grows from 3 to 11 resident holons through 4 materializations, stops at grain 2 for
both objects, and returns the same six-evaluation certificate as the fully supplied
hierarchy: 0.074963% boundary error, `1.432e-16` conservation residual, contact time
`0.451311852`, and impulse `108270.676692`.

## Rust and WebAssembly boundary

The hot path is a direct Rust dependency. CIRISGame/Bevy should enable the core's `alloc`
feature and retain `RuntimeArena` plus a `RuntimeFrontier` workspace as resources. This
keeps JSON, JavaScript callbacks, trait objects, and ABI copies out of stepping.

CEWPOS-style sandboxing is supplied separately by `crates/ciris-sim-component`. Its WIT
world imports nothing and accepts typed scene/contact records. The adapter flattens them
into the same runtime arena and returns a typed resolution certificate. It is a trust and
control-plane boundary, not a per-frame call. The built core module has zero imports and
an embedded component type; the repository's `examples/lift.rs` produces and validates
the final WebAssembly Component without a globally installed `wasm-tools`.

On this Mac mini M4, both release component artifacts round to 38 KiB (38,101 bytes
before lifting and 38,443 bytes after). Both `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and
`wasm32-wasip1` compile gates pass for the runtime-enabled core.

## Storage-policy parity and cost

The same 15-holon adaptive sphere contact is executed through both arenas in a unit test.
Status, observables, error bound, conservation residual, evaluation count, active count,
and represented grain agree; floating results are checked by raw IEEE-754 bits.

`cargo bench -p ciris-sim-core --bench runtime_refinement --features alloc` isolates only
storage-policy overhead. These are medians of nine runs of 250,000 identical
two-evaluation certificates on the M4:

| path | ns / certificate | vs const |
|---|---:|---:|
| const arena | 15.79 | 1.000x |
| runtime arena, reused frontier | 15.07 | 0.954x |
| runtime arena, owned certificate/frontier | 32.32 | 2.046x |

The recommended runtime API is the reusable form: runtime sizing and variable-width
whole-state add no measurable penalty in this small selector benchmark (the compact
bitset is slightly faster in this run). The owned form is for one-shot/component calls,
where returning the frontier is more useful than avoiding one bitset allocation.

## Acceptance in this slice

1. Runtime REG+ sector table equals the machine-checked Lean table.
2. Expanded children exactly conserve constituent count, occupancy, and momentum.
3. Frontier refinement never changes the root gross state.
4. Irreducible whole-state survives without a factoring assertion.
5. Multiple realization channels coexist on one holon.
6. The mechanical evaluator certifies <=0.1% boundary error and <=1e-12 momentum
   residual without expanding latent interiors.
7. The library remains `no_std`, deterministic, and free of unsafe code. Its default
   feature set is allocator-free; runtime sizing opts into `alloc` without opting into
   `std`.
8. The const and runtime storage policies return bit-identical mechanical certificates.
9. The zero-import WIT guest compiles and lifts to a validated WebAssembly Component.
10. Adaptive runtime certification starts from three holons, materializes only unresolved
    boundary branches, and reproduces the prebuilt hierarchy's certificate exactly.

## Explicit remaining work

- Prove the aggregation/commutation theorem that bounds fine REG+ evolution by a
  boundary-supported residual. The current Rust composition check establishes the
  conserved ledger, not dynamical lumpability.
- Allocate one global error budget across nested encounters; the current certificate is
  for one interaction frontier.
- Replace the analytic sphere sampler with the CIRIS-generated boundary representation.
- Implement quantum/route, narrative/temporal, and agentic realization maps and evaluators
  over the same maximal choice object. They must not introduce sibling entity types or
  independent ontologies; each owes an update/readout/certificate before numerical claims.
- Couple refined mechanical boundary holons to the iterative simultaneous-contact solver
  still owed by the sparse contact layer.

Rapier remains a limiting-case control for classical rigid behavior, not the definition
of a holon and not the reference for non-mechanical channels.
