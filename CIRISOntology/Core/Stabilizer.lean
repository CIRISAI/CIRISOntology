CIRISOntology.Core.Stabilizer — the SIXTH wall, and Gottesman–Knill's
mechanism as a closure theorem.

The 1-rebit kernel of the Clifford stratum: the tableau view — the
signed-Pauli label of a matrix, `none` off the set — is CLOSED under Hadamard
conjugation (`tableau_closed_under_hadamard`) and NOT closed under the 3-4-5
rotation (`tableau_not_closed_under_rotation`), a fully RATIONAL orthogonal
non-Clifford whose witness pair (the pulled-back X against 2·I, both
unlabelled, split by the motion) prices magic out of the stabilizer tier.
That is why stabilizer circuits are a cheap tier and T-gates are not: the
label view rides the Clifford orbit with a rate map, and a non-Clifford
motion splits its fiber — the founding shape's sixth wall, joining parity,
CP phase, Record, exchange sign, and coherence. The n-qubit efficiency
statement is Gottesman–Knill (credited; Aaronson–Gottesman for tableaux),
never claimed here; this file is its mechanism in the square's currency.
Authored for the CIRISHolon spin-out and ported back so the lake carries
what the engine gates on.
