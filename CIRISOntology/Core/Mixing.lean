CIRISOntology.Core.Mixing — THE MIXING THEOREM: the closure defect contracts at
the chain's mixing rate, and determinism is exactly the case where it does not.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT IS PROVED HERE, AND IN WHICH CURRENCY.

`OBJECT.md`'s ladder gives "rent" the row **contraction — decay rate of the
induced dynamics on the fiber partition**, and `OBJECT_INVARIANT_HUNT.md`'s
remainder item 1 names the missing keystone: *the closure defect at lag m
contracts at the mixing time; deterministic ⇒ no mixing ⇒ no contraction.* This
file proves that keystone on FINITE state spaces, in TOTAL VARIATION.

The defect is `defect T v m`: the largest total-variation distance, over pairs
of states the view `v` cannot tell apart, between the view's m-step futures
started at each. In words: **does within-fiber position still matter for what
the view will see in m steps?** It is zero exactly when it does not.

  1. `tv_app_le` — **DOBRUSHIN CONTRACTION.** `tv (μT) (νT) ≤ α(T) · tv μ ν`,
     with `α(T)` the Dobrushin ergodicity coefficient (the largest TV distance
     between two rows). Proved from scratch: Mathlib v4.14 carries no Dobrushin
     coefficient and no total-variation contraction lemma for kernels — its
     `SignedMeasure.totalVariation` is the Jordan-decomposition measure, a
     different object — so the TV distance used here is defined locally.
  2. `defect_le_alpha_pow` — **THE KEYSTONE.** `defect T v m ≤ α(T)^m`, for
     every row-stochastic `T`, every view `v`, every lag `m`. Whenever
     `α(T) < 1` the defect is forced to zero geometrically; the rate is the
     chain's, not the view's.
  3. `alpha_le_one_sub_card_mul` (Doeblin) and `defect_noisy_le` — the
     quantitative instance: a deterministic engine `f` run with per-step noise
     `ε` has `defect ≤ (1-ε)^m`. Noise is what buys contraction, and how much.
  4. `det_defect_zero_or_one` — **THE DETERMINISTIC COROLLARY.** For a
     deterministic step the defect is 0 or 1 AND NOTHING BETWEEN: a 0/1
     sequence cannot decay at any rate, so "contraction" is not a small effect
     on a deterministic substrate, it is a category error.
  5. `det_defect_eq_zero_iff_closed` — and the 0 case is exactly
     `Habit.Closed v (f^[m])`. So the defect IS the closure predicate of
     `Core/Habit.lean`, given a number by the stochastic setting, and
     `closed_iff_fiber_invariant` is the m = 1 reading.
  6. `alpha_detKernel_eq_one`, `alpha_eq_one_of_injective` — every non-constant
     deterministic step, permutations included, has `α = 1`, so bound (2) is
     VACUOUS there. The theorem does not fail on determinism; it says nothing,
     which is the honest form of "no mixing ⇒ no contraction".
  7. `swap_defect_odd`, `copySecond_defect_succ` — two exhibited witnesses that
     the vacuity is real. A PERMUTATION (`Habit.swapPair`, whose non-closure is
     already `Habit.not_closed_witness`) holds `defect = 1` at every odd lag; a
     non-injective deterministic step holds `defect = 1` at EVERY lag `m ≥ 1`,
     constant forever.

**B1/B3 BECOME COROLLARIES.** `scratchpad/composition/COMPOSITION2_RESULTS.md`
records arm B3 as "no contraction at any lag (τ_c = None)" on a deterministic
engine, and diagnoses it as determinism rather than a model failure. Items 4, 6
and 7 are that diagnosis as a theorem: on a deterministic substrate the defect
cannot contract, whatever the substrate is, because α = 1 and the defect is
integer-valued. B1's "hidden determinism is a universal common driver" is the
same fact seen from the other side — item 5 says a deterministic defect is a
PREDICATE (closed or not), so a null calibrated on contraction rates has no
scale to calibrate against.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
WHAT IS **NOT** PROVED HERE. Read this before quoting anything above.

- **FINITE STATE SPACES ONLY.** Every result assumes `Fintype X`. Nothing here
  covers continuous state spaces, where the Dobrushin coefficient needs a
  measure-theoretic TV and the sup over rows becomes an essential sup.
- **TOTAL VARIATION, NOT MUTUAL INFORMATION.** The programme's usual defect
  currency is an information quantity (`Core/Share`, `Core/ShareK`). TV is what
  contracts under a linear semigroup; the relation "TV defect small ⇒ order-3
  share small" is NOT proved here and must not be assumed. Pinsker gives one
  direction between KL and TV and is not imported.
- **NO CONVERSE.** `α(T) < 1` is sufficient for contraction and is NOT claimed
  necessary. A chain with `α(T) = 1` can still mix (α is a one-step, worst-pair
  coefficient; the true mixing rate is `α(T^m)^{1/m}`, and `α` is only its
  crudest upper bound). In particular NOTHING here says a stochastic substrate
  that fails this bound fails to contract.
- **α IS NOT THE SPECTRAL GAP.** `α(T) < 1` implies a gap; the converse fails.
  Remainder item 4 (`g_c` priced by the spectral gap) is untouched.
- **THE MEASURE μ_c IS ABSENT.** The defect here is a worst-case over fiber
  pairs, not an average against a within-fiber measure. `StochasticHabit`'s R3
  successor is still owed; a μ_c-averaged defect would be a different (smaller)
  quantity and its contraction is not proved by these lemmas.
- **NO CLAIM ABOUT ANY PHYSICAL SYSTEM.** τ_R and the 20 ms tweezer reading are
  named in `OBJECT_INVARIANT_HUNT.md` as MEASURED instances. This file supplies
  the theorem they would instantiate; it measures nothing.
- **`defect = 0` IS NOT `Closed` IN GENERAL.** Item 5 is proved for the
  deterministic kernel only. For a genuinely stochastic `T` there is no
  deterministic step map for `Habit.Closed` to be about.

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CREDITS, generously, claiming only the mechanization and the fiber reading.
The ergodicity coefficient and the contraction inequality are **Dobrushin
(1956)**, "Central limit theorem for nonstationary Markov chains"; the coupling
proof used here is the textbook one. The Doeblin minorization
(`alpha_le_one_sub_card_mul`) is **Doeblin (1938)**. The whole apparatus —
mixing time, TV distance, the fact that a deterministic chain does not mix — is
standard and is presented in **Levin & Peres, "Markov Chains and Mixing Times"**
(§4.5, §12), which is the reference a reader should use. Ours is: (a) the Lean
mechanization, absent from Mathlib v4.14; (b) the identification of the
contracting quantity with `Core/Habit.lean`'s `Closed` predicate, which is what
makes it a statement about the fiber ladder rather than about chains.

KILL, separable, and it does not touch the ladder beneath it: exhibit a finite
row-stochastic `T`, a view `v`, and a lag `m` with `defect T v m > α(T)^m`.
That falsifies `defect_le_alpha_pow` alone. Separately: exhibit a DETERMINISTIC
step map, a view and a lag whose defect lies strictly between 0 and 1 — that
falsifies `det_defect_zero_or_one` and with it the claim that determinism
forbids contraction rather than merely resisting it.

    this inequality (its `SignedMeasure.totalVariation` is the Jordan
    decomposition, a different object), so it is proved here from scratch, by
    the textbook coupling identity.

    Note, stated because the hypothesis a reader expects is absent: the
    INEQUALITY needs no row-stochasticity. It is linear algebra about `α`. What

/-- **THE QUANTITATIVE MIXING COROLLARY.** The SAME deterministic engine whose
    defect is constant at `1` (witness 2) has defect at most `(1-ε)^m` once each
    step carries noise `ε`. Contraction is bought by the noise, and the price is
    named: this is the theorem that arm B3 of
    `scratchpad/composition/COMPOSITION2_RESULTS.md` was calibrated against and
    that its deterministic substrate could not supply. -/
